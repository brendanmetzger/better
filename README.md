*this is temporarily abondoned, but the idea came to fruition came true some time ago at the computer internet website representing the [Sound Opinions](http://soundopinions.org) radio show*

## Proposed Solutions for "text" database

1. Data portability
2. Redesign or wholesale site changes will be arbitrary
3. Development can be understood by any developer who understands regular expressions
4. Editing can be accomplished in one interface using an easily learned syntax
5. Better mapping of keywords and site organization (sections, order, relationships, embeds)
6. Agnostic development
7. Version control can be accomplished w/ better, actual version control
  * Git could be used to store all files
  * Every 'save' indicates that a commit has been authored
  * backup machines could clone repo and thus redundancy is offered
  * ultimately editors could edit offline on local machines
  * A push would also update site, similarity of project.
  * Two editors could work on same file.
