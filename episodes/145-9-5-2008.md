## News
1 September is a time of mixed emotions. For some, it's an exciting new beginning. For others, it's a time of doom and dread. Either way, here are some of Jim and Greg's favorite Back-To-School songs to kick off the new school year.

Jim 
Screaching Weasel, "Cool Kids"
Buffalo Tom, "Lolly Lolly, Lolly Get Your Adverbs Here"
Frank Zappa, "Catholic Girls"
Mission of Burma, "Academy Fight Song"

Greg
Peter Tosh, "You Can't Blame the Youth"
The Specials, "Rat Race"
Steely Dan, "My Old School"
The White Stripes, "We're Going to Be Friends"

2 Jim and Greg also hear from some listeners with their suggestions to beat the end-of-summer blues.

The Style Council, "Long Hot Summer"
The Smiths, "The Headmaster Ritual"
Lulu, "To Sir With Love"
Bob Seger, "Night Moves"

3 The Walkmen recently released their fourth proper album called You and Me. The band has always presented a rather boozy mood, so it's fitting that Jim describes this album as about as fun as a hangover. He compares their sound to Tom Waits meets The Velvets, but doesn't think they pull it off. Jim is also not impressed by the instrumentation and gives You and Me a Trash It. Greg thinks The Walkmen do a great job of creating a murky, lost in space vibe, but wishes there was more variety. He thinks only about half of the songs are successes, and would therefore recommend listeners Burn It.
