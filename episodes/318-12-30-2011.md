## News
1 Of all the music news stories of the year-breaking album sales, label consolidation, streaming services-the one word that kept coming up again and again was "cloud." To help them look back at this year's biggest industry development, Jim and Greg have invited on New York Times reporter Ben Sisario. The three talk about streaming services like Spotify, the battle between iTunes, Google and Amazon, and whether or not the big labels have finally caught up to the times.

2a As 2011 comes to a close, it's a great time to think about the songs that defined the year. Jim and Greg have compiled their favorite songs into mixtapes. During the show you'll hear a small selection, but luckily you can stream both mixes in their entirety. And you can make your own.

Happy New Year from Sound Opinions!
