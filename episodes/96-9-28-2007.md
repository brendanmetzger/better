## News
1 The first album up for review is folk legend Joni Mitchell's first release in over nine years. The singer/songwriter famously quit the music biz in 2002 and criticized the record industry, calling it a "cesspool'" full of "pornographic pigs." So it's surprising she's back at all, let alone with a Starbucks deal. For the album Shine, Mitchell has joined Paul McCartney on the Hear Music label, owned by the coffee chain. Jim is shocked by her choice to associate herself with such megalithic corporation, but Greg understands why someone who doesn't get commercial radio play would go this route. The music itself is another story. Jim absolutely "hated" this record. He realizes that dissing Joni Mitchell might get him kicked out of the critic's club, but after seven listens, he found no reason not to Trash It. Greg thinks Joni's harmonics, chords and voicing are as good as ever, but he doesn't find many traces of the great songwriting fans heard with "Big Yellow Taxi." He wished the lyrics had a little more poetry and a little less-finger pointing. That said, according to Greg Joni's always worth hearing, so he gives Shine a Burn It.

2 Next up is another female singer/songwriter, Jill Scott. After her successful 2000 debut Who Is Jill Scott? Words & Sounds Vol. 1, Scott established herself as one of the most powerful voices in R&B and Soul. Now she's back with The Real Thing: Words and Sounds Vol. 3, which Greg describes as having two stylistic poles, strong and sassy and soft and soul-searching, with a whole lot of "boot-knocking" music in between. Both Jim and Greg are fans of Scott, but wish there was more spunk and more hooks on this record, since they know she is capable of it. The Real Thing is a real Burn It.

3 Brighton, England sextet Go! Team also released an album this month called Proof of Youth. Jim and Greg first became aware of the group after they performed at the Intonation Music Festival in 2005 and released their debut Thunder, Lightning, Strike. This sophomore effort follows the same exuberant formula, pairing cheerleading-style vocals with samples and horns. Greg thinks they borrow much of their aesthetic from Public Enemy, but the key difference is production. While the hip hop group provided great beats and a heavy bottom, the Go! Team album was very hard for Greg to listen to-very tinny, no bottom, and like a second rate Public Enemy recording. He gives it a Trash It. Jim couldn't disagree more. He finds their high-energy performance totally fresh and irresistible. Proof of Youth has been making Jim smile since the first time he listened to it, so he gives it a Buy It.

4 Jim and Greg have been arguing about the merits of this next artist for what seems like a lifetime. And, luckily for us, they aren't tired of it yet. Bruce Springsteen is back with the E Street Band for a new record called Magic. The Boss and his band haven't always had an easy relationship in their 33-year history, but they decided to take another go at it after 2002's The Rising, although as Jim explains, the singer/songwriter and the E Street musicians didn't spend any actual time together in the studio. And that's part of the problem for Jim. The effort feels very contrived to him, and he just doesn't buy the Springsteen "schtick." As with most of Springsteen's songs, the ones on Magic express nostalgia for a golden age that was never that golden. He wishes Springsteen had followed suit with his peers, Neil Young and Tom Petty, and expressed political feelings in a bold way. This critic gives Magic a Trash It. Greg thinks Jim completely misunderstood the songs on this record. He prefers not to be "bludgeoned" with ideas, and finds this release to be one of Springsteen's best records in over 25 years. He gives it a Buy It.

5 Another big album this fall is Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace from the Foo Fighters. The group started off as a lark for former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl, but now, six albums later, they are one of the most consistently successful commercial rock acts around. And Jim just can't understand why. Granted, the age-old formula of quiet verse, loud-chorus, repeat is a proven one, but he calls Grohl one of the worst lyricists in rock. Luckily he's also good at crafting hooks. Greg agrees that this is the only reason that the Foo Fighters have any appeal-they are catchy and not that complicated. He says there's no reason anyone needs to own more than one Foo Fighters record, and encourages the listener to completely ignore this release. Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace gets two Trash Its.

6 The final record up for review is from U.K. singer PJ Harvey. White Chalk is the first record Harvey has written using the piano as her instrument, rather than the guitar. And as evidenced by her organ-influenced 1995 masterpiece, To Bring You My Love, when Polly Jean learns a new instrument, wonderful things happen. For this album, the singer appears to be adopting the role of a ghost, telling dark and haunted tales of love and loss. Jim and Greg admit this is an album that takes some getting used to and recommend letting it creep under your skin. They both give two big Buy Its to White Chalk.
