## News
1 Jim and Greg start the show by warning listeners that their tax-free downloading days might soon be over. With e-commerce sales exceeding $130 billion a year, and iTunes sales hitting $5 billion, it was only a matter of time before the states started to want a piece. This year 9 states have considered digital download taxes, and 5 of those have already enacted them into law. Certain purchases will never be subject to tax if the vendor doesn't have a physical presence in that state, but the bigger issue is that whether it's through taxes on sales, taxes on file-sharing, or taxes on internet usage, the government's going to get its piece of the pie.

2 Isaac Hayes passed away earlier this week at the age of 65. As Jim and Greg reveal, the self-taught musician started out as a songwriter at Stax Records in the early 60's. He became a "master arranger," and his raps and braggadocio provided a prototype for modern hip hop. But, he is of course most well-known for his Oscar-winning song "Theme from Shaft," which was dramatic both musically and lyrically.

3 This week's guests are She & Him, the "she" being actress Zooey Deschanel and the "him" being musician Matt Ward, known to fans as M. Ward. The two met during the making of the movie "The Go-Getter," and quickly learned they were successful collaborators. She & Him's first album Volume One, is a collection of songs written by Zooey, as well as a couple of covers. Zooey explains that she's most influenced by classic pop songwriting, much of which pre-dates rock and roll. You can hear the country, doo-wop and Brill-building influence on the duo's music as they perform their songs "Take It Back" and "You've Really Got a Hold on Me" as well as two bonus tracks.

4 Zooey and Matt's visit to the show prompted Jim and Greg to think about other Hollywood crossover attempts-both hits and misses. Here are some other musical actors:

Eddie Murphy
Ricky Nelson
Brandon Cruz
Will Oldham
Scarlett Johansen
William Shatner

And many more...

5 After seeing Brazilian Girls wow crowds at Lollapalooza, Jim and Greg wanted to review the latest album from the international quartet called New York City. Jim compares the group to Stereolab, with influences in 60's lounge music, as well as German krautrock, but explains they are more danceable. He loves lead singer Sabina Sciubba's on-stage and on-record persona which is part Nico, part Jane Birkin and part Astrud Gilberto. He gives the album a Buy It. Greg is less enthused. He finds the album to be pleasant, but less up-tempo than previous efforts. He wishes they had more to say and thinks it's just merely background music. He gives it a Burn It.
