## News
1 Everyone has a cheesy pop skeleton in his or her musical closet-even rock critics. This week Jim and Greg fess up and reveal their musical Guilty Pleasures. These are songs that our hosts know are not "cool" or "artistic," but for whatever reason, they love 'em. And at Sound Opinions we have a completely populist philosophy about music. If it's got a good beat, and you can dance to it, enjoy it.

Here are Jim and Greg's Guilty Pleasures

Jim
Everlast, "Saving Grace"
P.M. Dawn, "Downtown Venus"
Ted Nugent, "Good Friends and a Bottle of Wine"

Greg
John Fred And His Playboy Band, "Judy in Disguise (With Glasses)"
Sweet, "Blockbuster"
The Moody Blues, "Late Lament"

2 Jim and Greg didn't want to be alone in confessions. They invited some listeners to come clean as well. 

Alec from New Orleans 
Captain and Tennille, "Love Will Keep Us Together" 

Liana from Portland 
"Part of Your World" from The Little Mermaid

Dan from Philadelphia 
Cyndi Lauper, "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"

Brady from Concord, NH 
Richard Harris, "MacArthur Park"

3 In his 4 decades in music, Tom Petty has appeared to do it all. He's been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, he's performed at the Superbowl, and he's collaborated with everyone from George Harrison to Johnny Cash. So, Jim and Greg wonder, what's left to accomplish? On his new album Mojo, it sounds like the only goal was to have an easy-going jam. That's not a bad thing, necessarily, but Jim feels like the fight has gone out of Petty. Greg agrees, explaining that Mojo is more about the band's performances and the songs themselves. Both critics give Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers a Burn It rating.

4 After years battling with his major label J Records, rapper Rhymefest has finally released an album on his own. El Che is his 2nd official release, though he put out a fascinating (and unauthorized) Michael Jackson tribute in 2008. As Greg explains, this record definitely doesn't fit in a major label model-it's too hard to market as one thing. It's funny, political and poppy. But, because of that, the sound of El Che is sometimes erratic and not as strong as his debut. Greg gives the record a Burn It. Jim disagrees. He hasn't seen this kind of strength of character in hip hop in a long time. Rhymefest is indeed weird, but he's funny, unique and totally himself. Jim gives El Che a Buy It.
