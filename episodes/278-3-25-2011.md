## News
1 Blues piano player Pinetop Perkins passed away this week at age 97. He was one of the last links to the Mississippi Delta blues era. As Greg relays, Perkins made his mark as a sideman for people like Muddy Waters. It wasn't until he was 75 that he released an album under his own name. And he holds the record for oldest Grammy winner. Pinetop Perkins was going strong right up until his death, so to honor him, Jim and Greg play the song that gave him his name, "Pinetop's Boogie Woogie," recorded at Sun Studios in 1953.

2 Music fans and industry insiders have been gathering at the SXSW Music and Media Conference in Austin, TX for 25 years. While it has gotten too big for its britches in recent years, SXSW remains the place to hear new artists and issues facing the business. Jim and Greg didn't have high hopes for this year's keynote speaker Bob Geldof. What has the Boomtown Rats done for us lately? Well, not much. But he provided one of the most insightful keynotes our hosts have ever heard. Geldof, who brought the world Live Aid, encouraged American musicians to wake up. He explained that rock 'n' roll needs to be against something -whether that's in reality or in spirit. Another noteworthy panel featured independent concert promoters from around the country, as well as Ticketmaster CEO Nathan Hubbard. The Ticketmaster/Live Nation merger was approved last year, and this panel attempted to find out how that has affected the concert industry. There were no concrete answers; ticket prices have skyrocketed but it's too early to attribute this to consolidation.

4 The Strokes hit it big in 2001 by asking the question Is This It? And it seems that it was (couldn't resist). They released two underwhelming subsequent records and then went their separate ways. Now the group is more of a democracy, but the missteps Jim and Greg heard on Julian Casablancas' solo album Phrazes For the Young are evident on The Strokes' new album Angles. Jim calls it glossy and overproduced, and wonders where Fabrizio Moretti's terrific drumming is. But worse, the band sounds "artistically bankrupt." He says Trash It. Greg is not so disappointed. Ultimately Angles is a failed record, but it tries new things and is therefore a more interesting record. He is optimistic about the future and says Burn It.
