Titus Andronicus

## News
1 Just a couple of years ago MySpace was the place to check out new bands and share them with friends. Now, their user base is shrinking while Facebook is up to 500 million users. So they are cashing in on the music scene and re-launching Music on Facebook. It certainly lends itself to interacting with artists, but what about the listening? That remains to be seen.

2 Producer Phil Spector was once known as the architect of the "Wall of Sound." But from now on he'll be known as a convicted murderer. A California appeals court rejected Spector's bid to overturn his murder conviction, saying it was permissible for prosecutors to call other women who said he had threatened them with guns in the past. He's now serving 19 to life in prison. His first trial ended in a hung jury.

3 The members of Titus Andronicus named their band after a Shakespeare play, their first album after a Seinfeld reference, and the latest called The Monitor was influenced by the Civil War. Needless to say this isn't your average punk band. During their visit to Sound Opinions, lead singer Patrick Stickles talks to Jim and Greg about his book smart lyrics and New Jersey roots. They also perform live. Here's video of their appearance.

4 The Beastie Boys started out as snotty punks fighting for their right to party. But now they have more in common with vets like R.E.M. and U2. Their 8th album, Hot Sauce Committee Part Two, was much delayed, in part, because of Adam "MCA" Yauch's battle with cancer. But now it's here, and they haven't skipped a beat. The Beastie Boys are hardly boys anymore, but they make no attempt to be up to date. What they lack in edge they make up for in humor. Jim and Greg give this a joyful Buy It rating.

5 Going back to New Jersey, Jim and Greg next review the new album by The Feelies. As Greg explains, they don't rush anything. The band started in the late '70s and has only produced five studio albums. But Here Before is worth the wait. Jim has a soft spot for The Feelies, but that actually makes him a tougher critic. He initially found this release a little sleepy, but grew to appreciate its small pleasures. Greg oddly recommends this new album as an introduction to new listeners. It's a survey of the high points of their career. Here Before gets a double Buy It.
