## News
1 Let's face it. Rock and roll can be plain scary to a lot of folks. But there are some songs and artists that go above and beyond and give even our hosts the creeps. Here are some of their favorite Scary Rock Songs to set the mood this Halloween.

Jim
Salem, "King Night" 
Pere Ubu, "Dub Housing"
Apocalyptica featuring Nina Hagen, "Seemann"
Ween, "Spinal Meningitis (Got me Down)"

Greg
Willie Dixon and Koko Taylor, "Insane Asylum"
H"usker D"u, "Diane"
Handsome Family, "My Ghost" 
Sunn O))) featuring Julian Cope, "My Wall"

2 On Sound Opinions, of course, everyone is a critic. So here are songs that give some of our listeners the heebie jeebies.

Pat from St. Paul, MN: Tom Waits, "What's He Building?" 
Margaret from Manhattan, KS: Old Time Relijun,"Cold Water"
Scott from Chicago, IL: Bobby "Boris" Pickett, "Monster Mash" 
Jon from Cincinnati, OH: Black Sabbath, "Black Sabbath"

3 For their latest release Write About Love, Scots Belle and Sebastian have yet again traded rainy Glasgow for sunny Los Angeles. On their last release, The Life Pursuit, this sun translated into a more upbeat dance record. But, now they have returned to their orchestral folk roots, and Greg wishes they had continued moving forward with their sound, rather than backwards. He appreciates singer Stuart Murdoch's vocals and witty lyrics, but this feels like a retreat. Greg gives Write About Love a Burn It rating. Jim thinks Greg hasn't been this wrong in a long time. He agrees that The Life Pursuit was a welcome change of pace, but really loves this album as well. It is toned down, but not precious and more full of edge. Simply put, Write About Love puts Jim in a great mood and he gives the record a Buy It.
