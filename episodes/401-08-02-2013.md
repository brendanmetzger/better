## News
While pop divas like {artist: Katy Perry} and {artist: Lady Gaga} have impressive strategic plans for their upcoming albums, news from {artist: Beyonce}’s camp suggest things are more chaotic over there. Sources told the Hollywood Reporter she recently scrapped 50 songs and is starting over, despite having the promotional push of the Superbowl and a world tour. 

Is it fair to say {name: Jack White}’s an all-around good guy? 00:05:01 First, he may have donated money to a {place: Detroit} baseball field. Then he pitches in to save the city’s historic Masonic Temple. And now he’s made a generous $200,000 donation to the National Recording Preservation Foundation. Three cheers for this former guest!

Influential {tag: guitar} player and {tag: songwriter} {name: J.J. Cale} died this week at age 74. Countless musicians have covered Cale over the years, from Captain Beefheart to Neil Young. And to honor him, Jim and Greg play one of Young’s favorites, “Crazy Mama.” 

## Picks
The history of {genre: rock ‘n’ roll} is filled with memorable lyrics, but sometimes it’s the wordless songs that stick. This week, Jim and Greg celebrate the Best Instrumentals. Not just any “{tag: instrumental}” track will do. Both Jim and Greg agree, no “fa fa fa’s” or “la la la’s” admitted. Here are their lists:

### Greg 
* Duane Eddy, “Peter Gunn”
* Booker T. & The MG’s, “Time is Tight”
* Higher Intelligence Agency, “Spectral”
* Deltron 3030, “Mastermind (Instrumental)”

### Jim
* {artist: Dick Dale}, “{track: Misirlou}”
* {artist: Wire}, “{track: The Commercial}”
* {artist: Future Sound of London}, “{track: Antique Toy}”
* {artist: Keyboard Money Mark}, “{track: Revolt of the Octopi}”

### Jim and Greg also spin a few listeners’ picks:
* Drew James in West Allis, Wisconsin: Frank Zappa, “Peaches En * Regalia”
* Amy Loberger in Oak Creek, Wisconsin: Led Zeppelin, “Moby Dick”
* Andy Mitchell in Chicago, Illinois: Four Tet, “My Angel Rocks Back and * Forth”
* John Chrissos in Rochester, New York: Simple Minds, “Theme for Great Cities”
* Marshall Preddy in Houston, Texas: Uncle Tupelo, “Sandusky”

## Review
Call ‘em {genre: doom metal} or {genre: stoner rock}, the {place: Chicago} band {artist: Trouble} has been bringing the heavy since {era: 1979}. The band’s new album {album: The Distortion Field} reunites original {tag: guitarist}s {name: Bruce Franklin} and {name: Rick Wartell}, and subs in Kyle Thomas for longtime {tag: vocalist} {name: Eric Wagner}. Does the reunited band fare better with the critics than Black Sabbath did recently? Greg says yes, though there are four or five Trouble albums he’d rank above The Distortion Field. The band hasn’t updated its original sound: an innovative merger of British {genre: heavy metal} and {genre: psychedelia}. That’s fine by Greg, but he does miss the conceptual heft Wagner gave to earlier Trouble lyrics. Greg gives The Distortion Field a {tag: Burn It}. Jim agrees. He needed some head-banging this week, and for that The Distortion Field does just fine. Burn It.
