## News
1 Today's theme is Hero Worship. The genesis of this idea was that we here at Sound Opinions started noticing that a lot of artists have written songs about their own heroes. Think of Bob Dylan's "Song To Woody." It's the kind of love only one rocker could express to another. Though when it comes to name-checking important musical figures, critics like Jim and Greg come a close second. Here are their favorite moments of musical Hero Worship.

Jim
The Replacements, "Alex Chilton" 
Television Personalities, "I Know Where Syd Barrett Lives"
Cheap Trick, "Surrender"
Robyn Hitchcock, "I Saw Nick Drake"

Greg
Van Morrison, "Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)"
The Hold Steady, "Constructive Summer"
Frank Black, "I Heard Ramona Sing"
Stevie Wonder, "Sir Duke"

2 After being cut loose from his major-label deal, singer/songwriter Van Hunt has a new independently released album out called What Were You Hoping For. Jim and Greg received exactly what they were hoping for - a musically inventive album that doesn't fit into one particular genre. Van Hunt is finally free to let his freak flag fly, and fly it does. Jim and Greg compare him to George Clinton and Prince and encourage you to Buy It.

3 Some call Mastodon the saviors of metal. Others...hipster sellouts. But Jim and Greg just think they make terrific music. Combining a little Black Sabbath with a little Melvins, they are experimental and hard rocking without losing their sense of melody and harmony. Their new album The Hunter marks five successful releases in a row. Jim and Greg say Buy It.
