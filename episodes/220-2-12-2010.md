## News
1 Just when you thought there couldn't be any more posthumous Jimi Hendrix releases, there's news that a new album will see the light of day in March. And, we have a preview song called "Valleys of Neptune." During his short life, Hendrix only released 3 records. But since his death over 30 albums have been released. Jim and Greg explain that "Neptune" is reflective of the guitarist's post-Electric Ladyland period. He was focusing less on guitar work and more on experimental lyrics. And, of equal interest to the music is the business of Hendrix.

2 It's Valentine's Day, and one of the most important elements to "Set the Mood" is, of course, music. Jim and Greg play their favorite mood setters:
