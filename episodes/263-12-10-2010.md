## News
1 Last week Jim and Greg reviewed the new album by The Black Eyed Peas. And this week we were sure it would be a #1 hit. But if there's anyone that can give the Peas a run for their money, it's...Susan Boyle? The Britain's Got Talent winner is the top seller of the week with her new album The Gift, beating out not only The Black Eyed Peas, but Kanye West and Taylor Swift. This news is further evidence that the physical album chart is dominated by people who still buy physical albums, aka older folks. Which leads to the next story...

2 Billboard has recognized that its standard album chart might not be a fully accurate representation of what's "popular" in music. In today's world, an artist's tweets, followers, fans, friends and hits are just as important indicators as record sales. So with that in mind they've launched the new Social 50 chart. At the top of Social 50 are artists like Rihanna, Justin Bieber, Eminem and Nicki Minaj-all performers who sell records. But, it also has the potential to recognize non-traditional acts like Widespread Panic, Girl Talk and Robyn, who consistently sell out shows, but don't have big retail presence. Jim and Greg welcome Billboard to the 21st century.

3 Still shopping for holiday gifts? If you've got a few thousand to spare, you could get your loved one the original lyrics to Bob Dylan's "The Times They Are a-Changin." And by a few thousand we mean $300K. That's how much the sheet of unruled notebook paper is expected to go for at an upcoming auction. December seems to be the month of rock memorabilia sales. Johnny Cash's jumpsuit, which he wore during his concert at San Quentin and made famous in this image, went for $50,000. Michael Jackson's glove sold for $300,000 and a decades old legal letter featuring John Lennon's original lyrics to "I'm Only Sleeping" are expected to go for over $500,000. Of course if this is too rich for your blood there's always Sound Opinions swag.

3 It's the moment all music fans wait for...the end! Without further ado:
