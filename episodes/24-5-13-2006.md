## News
1 First up in the news is a discussion of the sentence a judge handed to Daniel Biechele, the tour manager of the band Great White. Biechele was ordered to serve four years in prison and three years probation for setting a fire in a Rhode Island nightclub in February 2003, a blaze that killed 100 fans and injured twice that number. This was the fourth deadliest nightclub fire in U.S. history. The ruling represents a compromise between the defense and the prosecution, who were originally seeking a ten-year sentence, and victims' families are still awaiting the trial of the club owners later this summer. 

2 Another court case made the news this week. In the battle between The Beatles' Apple Corp. and Apple Computer over trademark infringement and their shared apple logo, the judge did not rule in favor of the Fab Four. The band was contending that Apple Computer and its iTunes Music Store had breached a 1980 trademark agreement by expanding onto their turf-the music industry. However, the judge, who does own an iPod, responded that "even a moron in a hurry," could tell the difference between the two companies. Now we just have to wait and see if the Beatles will finally release their songs to the online music retailer. Hopefully this will not confuse any of the morons in a hurry out there.

3 There was also an update on Keith Richard's health status, which was discussed last week. After a mysterious fall on the island of Fiji, Richards was admitted to a hospital in Auckland, New Zealand. Monday, after complaining of headaches, he underwent an operation, which, according to his publicist, was 100% successful. The Stones' camp has not said how he fell or what the operation was for, but reports speculate that it was to drain blood from his skull. They have, however, denied that there was more than one surgery or that Richards suffered any brain damage. Fans can expect to see the guitarist up, about and touring in June, and he already seems to be returning to his old, randy self.

4 Grant McLennan, the frontman of the Australian indie rock band The Go-Betweens, died in his sleep earlier this week. The singer/songwriter was 48. Greg discusses how The Go-Betweens, who were going strong up until McLennan's passing, were not necessarily commercially successful, but were very influential in the 1980s. Musicians like Bono and Morrissey and members of bands like R.E.M. and Coldplay have all sung the praises of McLennan and his partner Robert Foster. Many listeners will only know the band from their hit "Bachelor Kisses," but Greg points out that the songwriting pair penned many wonderful pop songs that were full of emotion and full of humanity. He chooses to play "Bye Bye Pride," and prompts audience members to listen to the oboe solo. 

5 This week's guests are the members of Art Brut: Eddie Argos, Ian Catskilkin, Jasper Future, Freddy Feedback, and Mikey B. Sound Opinions was anxious to get the British band on the show after seeing them play at the SXSW Festival in Austin, TX. The band, who got their name from a French theory of outsider art, was in Chicago as part of their first U.S. tour and just released their first album, Bang Bang Rock and Roll, in the U.S. earlier this week.

6 After lead singer and songwriter Eddie Argos warns the kids to "stay off the crack", we hear a bit of music by Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers. Richman, who Jim will talk more about later in the show, was a major influence on Argos as a songwriter. Argos explains that his career as a musician did not really come easily. After his former bandmates all left to go to university, Argos moved to London for a second try. There were not many takers though, because, as Argos explains, he is not much of a singer and can't play an instrument. Lucky for us, an inebriated Argos was able to convince just a few people to join him, and so emerged Art Brut.

7 What Argos perhaps lacks in singing talent and musical ability, he certainly makes up for in personality. Like singers such as Damon Albarn and Lou Reed, Argos knows that attitude, wit and a voice are more important than former singing training. That voice comes through in songs like "Formed a Band," where he expresses delight in the sheer act of forming a band. "Why not?" he explains to Jim and Greg. "Why can't we get on Top of the Pops?" People who have seen the band (who tours in a 40-foot tour bus) play live know that is a valid question indeed.

8 After their visit with Art Brut, Jim and Greg get back into serious critic mode, and take a look at two of the biggest albums to be released recently. The first up is Just Like the Fambly Cat by indie rock group Grandaddy. This is the 4th, and now last album, for the Californians. Singer/songwriter Jason Lytle decided to dissolve the band during the making of this album in favor of a simpler life. The conflict between modernity and nature has been a major theme in all of Lytle's songwriting, and a key to understanding this is the band's hometown of Modesto. While it is surrounded by the beautiful Northern California landscape, the city is also a victim of homogenized, suburban sprawl; its motto even boasts Modesto to be the city of "Water, Wealth, Contentment and Health." In addition, Modesto has an eerie connection to two of the most infamous crimes in recent times-both Lacey Peterson and Chandra Levy hail from he city. So, Jim and Greg understand why Lytle might want to leave. And they both agree that this album is a beautiful note to go out on. Just Like the Fambly Cat gets two Buy Its.

9 On a completely different note, progressive metal band Tool also has a new album out. 10,000 Days is the band's 4th album, and it debuted at number one on the Billboard Chart. Tool's commercial success is surprising considering the band's lack of self-promotion. They rarely get radio or MTV play, seldom do interviews, and perform practically in darkness. They are almost anonymous, yet have a huge cult following. Jim and Greg imagine this is because of the band's progressive rock vibe. They appeal to fans (especially teenagers) who love complete albums and desire to spend hours and hours mulling over one band's work. But, Jim points out, unlike prog rock groups like Rush and Genesis, Tool's music is lacking hooks. It's n"u-metal side kind of ruins the package for Jim and Greg. Therefore, despite the fun 3-D packaging, 10,000 Days only gets a Trash It from Greg and an reticent Burn it from Jim.

10 The opportunity to play Desert Island DJ goes to Jim this week. Inspired by his earlier discussion with Eddie Argos from Art Brut, Jim chooses a song by Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers to add to the Desert Island Jukebox. The Modern Lovers, who were hugely influenced by the Velvet Underground, would all go on to be a part of great projects: David Robinson started drumming for The Cars, Jerry Harrison played keyboards with the Talking Heads, and Ernie Brooks went on to play with a number of bands, including Rhys Chatham's guitar army which was discussed a few weeks ago. Richman took some bizarre turns, promising to only play music fit for a baby's ear, but the band's 1976 self-titled debut remains a masterpiece, according to Jim. He understands why Argos was so inspired by Richman's songwriting. Both men salute the "everyman dweeb" who struggle with getting girls and respect. While "Roadrunner" is perhaps the band's best known song, Jim decides to go with "She Cracked" as this week's DIJ pick.
