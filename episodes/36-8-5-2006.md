## News
1 MTV turns 25 this week, so to celebrate (or perhaps mourn), Jim and Greg discuss the station's impact on the music industry. Before weighing in on MTV-the good, the bad and the ugly-our hosts turn to Professor Paul Levinson, chairman of the department of communications and media studies at Fordham University, and Ken Tucker, editor at large for Entertainment Weekly and pop music critic for Fresh Air. We also hear from music fans at the Pitchfork Music Festival, which was held in Chicago last week. 

2 One thing that the Sound Opinions can't really do justice to on the radio is, of course, video. So Sound Opinions H.Q. would like to call attention to some of its favorite MTV video moments:

o Paula Abdul - Opposites Attract

o Aerosmith - Janie's Gotta Gun

o AHA - Take on Me

o Aphex Twin - Come to Daddy

o Bjork - Human Behavior

o Blur - Coffee and TV

o The Breeders - Cannonball

o Beastie Boys - So Whatcha Want

o The Cars - You Might Think

o Clipse - Grindin

o DJ Jazzy Jeff/Fresh Prince - Summertime 

o Dr. Dre - Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang

o Missy Elliott - take your pick...

o Peter Gabriel - Sledgehammer

o Michael Jackson - Thriller 

o Outkast - Bombs Over Baghdad

o Radiohead - Fake Plastic Trees

o Soundgarden - Black Hole Sun

o Talking Heads - Once in a Lifetime

o Van Halen - Hot for Teacher

o Wreckx-N-Effect - Rump Shaker

3 The first album up for review this week is by White Whale. This up and coming indie rock group from Lawrence, Kansas first caught the attention of our hosts at this year's SXSW Music Conference. Now they have released their debut album, WWI. Whether the title refers to the Great War, or a great record, is unclear. But, both Jim and Greg agree this album is worth a listen, though not necessarily a purchase. Jim loves the prog rock approach, but can't go with a full Buy It. Greg agrees, explaining that he likes the music and finds White Whale intriguing, but isn't clear on the emotional subtext. He wonders where the "meat" is. Therefore, WWI gets two Burn Its.

4 Shifting gears completely, Jim and Greg move on to Slayer. Christ Illusion is their first album since the one they released after 9/11/01, and the death metal rockers are as angry as ever. Greg describes some of the lyrics on the album as a "big middle digit" to all religions and all establishments of "the man." But, as our hosts explain, you don't listen to Slayer for political science lessons. They are a "great American rock band" because of what they do with guitar, bass and drums. Jim prefers them live, but both critics give Christ Illusion a Buy It rating.

5 Greg wraps up the show in true Sound Opinions style by picking a classic MTV moment for his Desert Island Jukebox pick. He highlights "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," which Nirvana performed live as part of MTV's Unplugged series. If Greg had to choose a single performance by the band, it would be this one. The late Kurt Cobain pours his heart and soul into it, and the band's backing is incredibly empathetic. Of course, Cobain did not pen this tune. It was originally recorded as "In the Pines" in the late 1930s, and Jim and Greg discussion its evolution as part of a conversation with cyberlaw and free culture guru Lawrence Lessig. Check out those footnotes and listen to a montage of its many incarnations.
