Mission of Burma

## News
1 In the news this week is the release of one of the most highly anticipated albums of the year: Outkast's Idlewild. This is the 6th album from Andre Benjamin (Dre) and Antwan Patton (Big Boi), a hip hop duo who have become major figures in pop music, as well as pop culture. 2003's Speakerboxx/The Love Below was a double concept album that received huge amounts of critical acclaim, as well a Grammy Award for "Album of the Year." And, singles like "Bombs Over Baghdad," "Rosa Parks," and "Hey Ya," will go down as some of music's best. So, Jim and Greg anxiously awaited this release, which is paired with a film of the same name. Unfortunately, they both had to announce that this is one of the biggest disappointments of the year. And, Sound Opinions H.Q. suspects Andre may be to blame. The melding of his experimental style with Big Boi's more classic, hip hop sound is what made Outkast great, but he seems to have really left the building on this one. Jim and Greg wish the record was less about eccentricity for eccentricity's sake, unnecessary guest stars and faux 1930's inspiration, and more about good songs. Therefore, this double album gets a heartbreaking double Trash It. 

Sound Opinions H.Q. thinks Outkast fans would be better off checking out Big Boi's recent mixtape, Got Purp? Vol 2. 

2 Another big album coming out this week is by pop princess Christina Aguilera. Or should we say pop queen. The former Mouseketeer is all grown up, and is asserting it on her latest release Back to Basics, (though not grown up in that "Dirty" way). Rather, the classier Mrs. Bratman attempted to make more classic, pop standards like the ones she grew up listening to. The first disc, produced by DJ Premier, is more club-oriented pop music. The second features live instrumentation and a big band sound, and was produced by Linda Perry, whom Jim refers to as the modern Diane Warren. The problem, according to Jim and Greg, is not that she cannot sing. In fact, she sings a little too well. They wished she showed a little restraint and didn't feel the need to show off her impressive pipes as much. Also, there is a problem with what Christina is singing about. Both hosts wish she would stop feeling so sorry for herself and her celebrity existence. Despite this, Jim and Greg believe there are a handful of songs worth checking out. Therefore Back to Basics gets two Burn It's.

3 The guests this week are the men of Mission of Burma: Roger Miller, Clint Conley, Peter Prescott, and Bob Weston. The post-punk pioneers were in Chicago to perform at the Pitchfork Music Festival, and they stopped by for a discussion and performance. Jim and Greg explain that Mission of Burma is a rare example of a band being able to break-up, reunite and continue to make music as good, if not better than they did before. Their first incarnation was in the early 1980s. They only recorded one album in 1982 and had to disband due to Roger's debilitating tinnitus, but their influence is undeniable. The band returned twenty years later to tour and record OnOffOn, and have recently released The Obliterati, which both Jim and Greg say may make it to their top ten lists.

4 Mission of Burma is known for combining pop melodies with quite a lot of noise. These characteristics often get the band thrown in the same pot as bands like Gang of Four and Wire, but listeners shouldn't confuse these post-punkers. One of Burma's distinctive features is their use of tape loops. During their first go-around, Martin Swope would handle this duty and record the band's sound and manipulate it live with a reel-to-reel tape machine. Now Shellac's Bob Weston has the job, and you can hear the effects on "Max Ernst," which they perform live on the show. Another famous looper is Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood, though he works digitally. 

5 Another Burma trademark is the songwriting. All three regular members, Roger, Clint and Peter, pen very smart, rather literate lyrics. An example of this is another song they perform live, "Donna Sumeria." While it was Roger's attempt at a love song, it's also a witty pun on Donna Summer and the ancient Middle Eastern civilization. Greg also cites it as an example of Burma's punk sensibility. Their music doesn't have rules and can even have disco elements. Fans should check out all their live songs, plus a bonus track here.

6 Both of the albums reviewed this week claim to draw inspiration from the music of the '30s and '40s, though Greg is not quite sure what music the men of Outkast and Christina Aguilera are hearing. He decides to step away from their rather cartoony depictions of the era and put some of the real thing into the Desert Island Jukebox this week. "Strange Fruit," by Billie Holiday has exactly the kind of authentic sound these contemporary artists should be striving for. The song began as a poem that Jewish schoolteacher Abel Meeropol wrote after witnessing a photograph of a man being lynched in the South. (Meerepol is also known for having adopted the orphaned children of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg). The writer brought the song to Holiday at one of New York's only integrated night clubs. Holiday's label refused to record the song; the singer insisted on performing it and went to a specialty label instead. The song has became an anthem for the anti-lynching movement and is thought of as one of the great protest songs of the century, but Greg wants listeners to pay attention to the performance as well. While Holiday certainly had the chops to trill as good as any pop diva, the singer restrains herself and opts for a more understated tone, making the lyrics even more chilling. She not only can sing, but knows how to sing. For this reason, Greg is going to take "Strangefruit" to the desert island.
