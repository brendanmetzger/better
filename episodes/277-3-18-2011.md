## News
1 Musicians throughout time, from Igor Stravinsky to MC Hammer to Girl Talk, owe a great debt to sampling. The act of quoting, re-contextualizing or "stealing" from other artists has become an artform in itself. But, the practice of sampling has also caused a lot controversy when it comes to the law and ideas about intellectual property. So Jim and Greg spend the bulk of today's episode digging into sampling. First they talk to Kembrew McLeod, a filmmaker and professor of communication studies at the University of Iowa. His latest documentary, Copyright Criminals, examines debates about the value and legality of sampling. 

2 Jim and Greg also play their favorite sample-based songs:

Jim
"Loser" by Beck / samples 
"Kick Push" by Lupe Fiasco / samples
"Groove Is In the Heart" by Deee-Lite / samples

Greg
"Power," by John Oswald
"Welcome to the Terrordome" by Public Enemy / samples
"Stem" by DJ Shadow / samples

3 It's hard to believe, but R.E.M. has put out its 15th album. The formerly indie quartet from Athens is now a major label trio, and many fans have been waiting for a "return to form." Well they get it with Collapse Into Now...sort of. As Jim and Greg explain, the record is full of nods to older R.E.M. material, but nothing as strong. Why not just sit back and listen to the albums from the '80s and '90s? They add that the loss of drummer Bill Berry keeps getting magnified as the years go by. Collapse Into Now gets a double Burn It.
