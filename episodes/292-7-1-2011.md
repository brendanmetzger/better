2 Is Jill Scott a contender for the next round of lists? Her new release The Light of the Sun is the number one album in the country, a first for Scott. The R&B singer started as a poet in Philadelphia and has gone on to have a successful music career, as well as an acting one. Since her last release in 2007, Scott has gone through tough breakups of the romantic and professional variety. And that's provided much of the subtext for the songs on The Light of the Sun. Jim doesn't think the level of self-pity is warranted though, especially when the music is so upbeat. He's not used to this tough lady feeling sorry for herself. And more disappointing is her singing. Jim says Trash It. Greg can't believe what he's hearing. This isn't a return to form, in his opinion, but a whole new territory. The record sounds loose and fun, and despite the massive life changes, Scott sounds remarkably resilient. He says Buy It.

3 Jim's Desert Island Jukebox selection is inspired by his television guilty pleasure: True Blood. While he was disappointed by the season premiere, he loved hearing Neko Case and Nick Cave duet on a cover of "She's Not There." But, nothing compares to The Zombies' 1964 original. It combines beautiful chords and harmony vocals with a dark, sinister undertone. Plus you can't beat those keys or Colin Blunstone's vocals.
