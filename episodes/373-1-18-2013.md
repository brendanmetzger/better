## News
1 Hard to believe, but The Beatles are so old that some of their music is now entering public domain in Europe. While a law is in place to extend copyrights in the E.U. from 50 to 70 years, that won't go into effect until 2014. That means that as of New Year's Eve 2012, early tracks like "Love Me Do" are up for grabs. Early tracks by Bob Dylan, however, have recently been protected. In order to avoid its catalog going into public domain, Sony Music has taken advantage of the law's "use it or lose it" clause. They released a compilation aptly titled, The 50th Anniversary Collection: The Copyright Extension Collection, Vol. 1. It's only available in certain European countries though, so American Dylan fans will have to be willing to pay big bucks on eBay.

2 This is typically the dry season for major album releases, but there have been a lot of buzzworthy singles. Jim and Greg run through some of the big ones. They never thought they'd utter the words "new David Bowie track," but we've got one called "Where Are We Now," with a Tony Visconti-produced album to follow. Then there's JT's new chart-topper "Suit and Tie." A couple of weeks ago Jim and Greg made a plea for the gentleman of Outkast to come back together, and now we have both Big Boi and Andre 3000 appearing on a remix of Frank Ocean's "Pink Matter." But, Andre is quick to squash any reunion rumors. Last, but not least, are the ladies of Destiny's Child. There's a new song called "Nuclear" and plans for the three to appear together during the Superbowl Halftime Show. Guess motherhood has made Beyonce nostalgic.

3 Next week, South Park and Book of Mormon creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone join Jim and Greg in the studio to talk music and comedy. The duo's trademark musical satire has won them tons of fans - and a few Tony awards. In advance of the boys' visit, Jim and Greg warm up the crowd with a mix of rock n' roll's Best Satirical Songs. Whether they're pointing a 
finger at society's ills or sending up pop music forms, these artists turn the funny up to 11.

Greg's Picks:
Frank Zappa & The Mothers of Invention, "Who Needs the Peace Corps?"
Dead Kennedys, "Holiday in Cambodia"
Tim Fite, "I've Been Shot"
Digital Underground, "The Humpty Dance"

Jim's Picks
Bill Cosby, "Hooray for the Salvation Army Band!"
Beck, "Debra"
Bongwater, "Free Love Messes Up My Life"
The Rutles, "Ouch!"

4 Indie veterans Yo La Tengo started making their version of the Velvet Underground's droning guitar rock in 1984. Jim and Greg have been listening ever since. (Jim - our own "Son of Jersey" - even caught the band's first show at Maxwell's in Hoboken). Over 13 albums, Jim says, Yo La's established itself as a band of impeccable taste. Greg admits their last few contemplative mood records have sounded a bit "samey." Do they shake things up on the latest release, Fade? Both Greg and Jim say "yes." The strings and "John Fahey-esque" acoustic guitar are pleasant surprises. As Greg notes, Ira Kaplan and Georgia Hubley's ruminations on their decades-long relationship give Fade a cohesive feel. It gets a double Buy It.
