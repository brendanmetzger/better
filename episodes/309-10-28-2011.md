## News
1 It's everyone's favorite time of year: Halloween! This is one of our most requested shows, so Jim and Greg are back with another installment of Scary Songs for the season. Here are their 2011 picks:

Greg
The Cure, "Subway Song"
Scott Walker, "Jesse"
Lupe Fiasco, "Put You On Game"
Bruce Springsteen, "State Trooper"

Jim
The Specials, "Ghost Town"
Nina Simone, "Pirate Jenny"
10CC, "I'm Not in Love"
Peter Gabriel, "Intruder"

2 Jim and Greg also turn the critic's duties over to some members of the audience. Here are some Halloween suggestions from listeners:

Frank from Philadelphia: Sonic Youth, "Cotton Crown"
Nicole from Naperville, IL: Queen, "Death on Two Legs"
David from Cleveland: Skinny Puppy, "The Killing Game" 
Stacy from Garner, N.C.: Neko Case, "Deep Red Bells"

3 Whenever we solicit nominations for Halloween songs, one name comes up time and time again: Tom Waits. The boozy saloon crooner has a creepy voice, and dark, edgy narratives to match. His latest is called Bad As Me, and yes, Jim says, that about sums it up. He hasn't been a fan of Waits since his Swordfishtrombones days, calling the singer/songwriter shticky and grating. This album is no different, and he says Trash It. Greg is a little surprised, considering this is Waits' most accessible, hook-laden effort in years. What Jim calls shtick, he calls theatricality. And he admits that sometimes the theatricality obscures the plain good songwriting, rooted in old blues. Greg especially likes the collaboration with keyboardist Augie Myers. He says Bad As Me is a Buy It.
