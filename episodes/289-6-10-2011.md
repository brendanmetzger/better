## News
1 Rock and roll is filled with Father Figures-some dear Dads and some deadbeat Dads. But, the male parent doesn't get nearly as much song time as Mom. So in honor of Father's Day, Jim and Greg decide to give the fathers some. Here are their favorite Songs About Dad.

Jim
Fire, "Father's Name Was Dad"
Loretta Lynn, "Coal Miner's Daughter"
Didjits, "Dad"
Neil Young, "Old Man"

Greg
David Bowie, "Kooks"
Grateful Dead, "Box of Rain"
Kelly Hogan, "Papa Was a Rodeo"
The Winstons, "Color Him Father"

2 Jim and Greg are joined by guest listener critics who share their song choices:

Roger from Chapel Hill, NC: John Hiatt, "Your Dad Did"
Jen from Chicago, IL: Paul Simon, "St. Judy's Comet"
Andrew from Ft. Wayne, IN: Lou Reed, "Beginning Of A Great Adventure"
Erin from San Francisco, CA: Shep and the Limelights, "Daddy's Home"

3 Raphael Saadiq is a music veteran at age 44. He was a member of the successful R&B group Tony! Toni! Ton'e!, and then Lucy Pearl. Now, he's released his 4th solo album called Stone Rollin'. Jim loves the vibe of it, even Robert Randolph's pedal steel guitar. You could accuse Saadiq of living in the past-he makes no bones about his roots-but he has the songwriting chops to put behind it. Jim gives this "great party record" a Buy It. Greg has always respected and liked Saadiq, but on this album he falls in love. He calls this album the singer/songwriter's crowing achievement, adding that Saadiq falls on the right side of the divide between retro and classic. Stone Rollin' gets a double Buy It.
