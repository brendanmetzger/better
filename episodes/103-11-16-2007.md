## News
1 Alicia Keys has a record out this week that's poised to be #1. Keys has been groomed by Clive Davis in the old school star-making machine, and has become one of the biggest recording artists of this decade. Jim has never been overly impressed by Keys' style which is part polished R&B, part gritty hip hop. But, As I Am is so campy and over the top, that he found himself enjoying the record...even the John Mayer duet. Like a bag of candy, Jim knows it's not good for him, but he gives the record a Buy It. Greg wants to like Keys a lot more; she's obviously got real talent. But, he thinks her lyrics are nothing but a string of clich'es. He also wishes she wasn't so bogged down by the over-production. He gives As I Am a Trash It.

2 Every Thanksgiving Jim and Greg celebrate by breaking out the double barrel and taking out the year's biggest musical "turkeys." These aren't just flops or bad records, but albums Jim and Greg had high hopes for that turned out to be disappointments. Here are this year's birds:

3 The second album up for review this week is The Black and White Album by Swedish rockers The Hives. The band had a hit in 2000 with "Hate to Say I Told You So," but have yet to really break through to mainstream audiences (despite obvious attempts by their record company). This album is a change of pace for the garage rockers and has more soul than listeners heard previously. They even teamed up with hip hop producer Pharrell Williams for a couple of tracks. The result works for Greg, though he wishes they'd edited down the number of tracks. Jim agrees that the merging of sounds is really successful. They have a credible groove. Both Jim and Greg give The Black and White Album a Buy It.



## Recurring Segments
DIJ: Jim 

This week it's Jim's turn to drop a quarter in the Desert Island Jukebox. Jim was inspired by a news story that broke this week, in which the seminal UK band, My Blood Valentine announced that they were reuniting. Valentine put out a record in 1991 that Jim called simply "one of the best songs ever." The warbling vocals combined with the ectasy inspired song makes My Bloody Valentine's song, "Only Shallow", this weeks DIJ pick.
