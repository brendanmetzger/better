## News
1 It's the Sound Opinions Christmas Spectacular!
Every year Jim and Greg hand the show's reigns over to the official Sound Opinions holiday music curator, Andy Cirzan (aka DJ Lo-Fi). By day, Cirzan is the Vice President of Concerts at Jam Productions, the largest independent concert promoter in the country. But by night, Cirzan scours the earth to find rare, and often times wacky, holiday music to add to his collection. This year is no exception. Below is a list of songs played on the show. Fans can also download DJ Lo-Fi's entire 2006 compilation, "S'eance With Santa," for free at Christmas.soundopinions.org. 

This offer is only available until Tuesday, December 26, however, so act now!
