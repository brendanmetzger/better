## News
1 Holiday music maven Andy Cirzan visits Sound Opinions every December to share with Jim and Greg a new collection of unique tunes for the season. From the weird to the wonderful, these are not your standard Christmas carols. By day Andy runs Jam Productions in Chicago. By night he searches through record stores, dustbins and basements to find gems for Sound Opinions and his annual compilation. This edition is called Santa Soul. You'll be treated to holiday soul comps of yesteryear. These are killer Xmas dusties from the '60s and '70s â€”tracks by well-known artists like James Brown, as well as groovy underground acts. So light up the yule log and let the soul party begin! Cheers from everyone at Sound Opinions!

*As a special bonus, listeners are invited to download Andy Cirzan's complete holiday compilation for FREE at christmas.soundopinions.org. The mix will only be up until the end of 2012, so get it while it's hot!
