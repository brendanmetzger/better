## News
1 The nail has just gone in the record store coffin. The Times Square Virgin Megastore, which is the highest volume music store in America, is closing this spring. $55 million in annual revenue was not enough to keep the doors to this landmark retail outfit open. Jim and Greg agree that the Virgin store on Broadway was an institution for any music fan who visited New York City, and hope that people continue to support what record stores are still out there.

2 Rocker, poet, fashion designer, activist...now Bono can add columnist to that ever-growing list. The U2 frontman just published his first official column for The New York Times. It was written about music's other great ego-Frank Sinatra. Jim doesn't see why anyone would be interested in the writings of Bono, except for the fact that he is a celebrity. But Greg is a little more hopeful. He admits that Bono is not a great scribe, but thinks that if the singer sticks to what he knows-music-we may be in for some interesting stories.

3 On January 20th, thousands will celebrate the Inauguration of President-Elect Barack Obama. But before that Jim and Greg wanted to host their own celebration by playing the best songs ever written about the office of Commander-in-Chief. 

Here's a collection of songs to kick off this new administration:

Jim
Neil Young, "Campaigner"
The Ramones, "Bonzo goes to Bitburg"
They Might Be Giants, "James K. Polk"
Lou Reed, "The Day John Kennedy Died"

Greg
JB Lenore, "Eisenhower Blues"
XTC, "Here Comes President Kill Again"
Wyclef Jean, "President"
George Clinton, "Paint the White House Black"

4 Scottish indie rockers Franz Ferdinand have a new album out called Tonight: Franz Ferdinand. It's the 3rd release for the New-New Wave band, and after a terrific debut, and a so-so follow-up, Jim and Greg were eager to see what the quartet had to offer. Greg hears a reconfiguration of their original sound. The dance element is more up front, making the rhythm section the most important one. Greg keeps waiting for lead singer Alex Kapranos to step up to the Bryan Ferry level, and until he does Greg gives Tonight: Franz Ferdinand a Burn It. Jim doesn't think it's fair to compare any mere mortal to Bryan Ferry and thinks Kapranos does a terrific job. He calls the group's routine "winning" and gives this album a Buy It.
