## News
1a Every Halloween Jim and Greg like to celebrate with music. And this year they focused on monsters. From vampires to werewolves to Jim’s favorite, zombies, here are a selection of tunes for your next monster bash.

Greg
The Cramps, “Human Fly”
TV on the Radio, “Wolf Like Me”
OutKast, “Dracula's Wedding”
Donovan, “Season of the Witch”

Jim
Concrete Blonde, “Bloodletting”
New York Dolls, “Frankenstein”
The Five Blobs, “Beware of the Blob”
Blue Oyster Cult, “Godzilla”

1b As always, on Sound Opinions everyone is a critic. So we also hear from some Halloween loving listeners.
Mary Lou from Los Angeles, “Zombie” by The Fallouts
Jason from Chicago, “The Shankill Butcher” by The Decemberists  
Leah from Chicago, “Teenage Ghouls Out for Blood” by American Werewolves
Dave from Saint Charles, IL, “Dead Man’s Party” by Oingo Boingo

2 How could we not end the Halloween special with a band from Salem, Massachusetts?() Metal group Converge has a new album out called All We Love We Leave Behind, and it continues their successful two-decade run. Converge is often referred to as “smart metal,” but Jim thinks “ambitious metal” is more apt. This especially applies to the drummer’s range of almost jazzy 
rhythms. Greg says few bands combine aggression with virtuosity better than Converge. The soundscapes are dreamlike and the guitar bursts mind-boggling. All We Love We Leave Behind gets two Buy It ratings.
