Radiohead

## News
1 This week on the show, Jim and Greg have very special guests: Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood of the band Radiohead. Our hosts were excited to have the lead singer and guitarist/multi-instrumentalist on the show, and recognize Radiohead as one of the most important bands of the past 2 decades. As you can hear in the podcast of the full interview (available next week at SoundOpinions.org) , Greg asserts that Radiohead's album Kid A is the most avant-garde album to ever debut at the top of the Billboard charts. It is rare that a band can be so experimental and still achieve so much mainstream success. Therefore, Sound Opinions H.Q. was thrilled to welcome them into our Navy Pier studio. 

2 Radiohead was in Chicago to perform two shows at the Auditorium Theatre, and when they are in town it is always memorable. Their 2001 outdoor performance at Hutchinson Field was a landmark event for Chicago music. Previously the city has not always been eager to invite droves of young rockers out into its public spaces. However, the success of the 2001 show seems to have paved the way for outdoor music concerts like Lollapalooza. Despite this, though, the Brits return to the city this year was not completely drama free. The city rejected the band's bid to play at Millennium Park, although it's not clear whether or not Radiohead would have even accepted. The band has never been one to do things twice, and they were eager to try out a smaller, indoor venue like the Auditorium Theatre.

3 Thom and Jonny explain that this tour was an opportunity to work on songs that may be a part of their upcoming 2007 release. Some suspected that there might not even be a next album, however. Radiohead's extended family keeps growing, as does their interest in solo work, so there was speculation that they might not continue in this incarnation. But, unlike bands of their stature who stay in business for the sake of the business, the bandmates explain that Radiohead will go on as long as the music makes it worth it. And in the meantime, they'll have to juggle the music with the nappies.

4 Doing solo projects is still a priority for members of Radiohead. Jonny composed the music for the 2004 film Bodysong, which he also co-produced. And Thom will be releasing The Eraser in July, though he explains that the term "solo" is not really appropriate in this case. The album was produced and arranged by longtime Radiohead collaborater Nigel Godrich, and contains music composed by his band mates. 

5 One of the songs on The Eraser, "Harrowdown Hill," was inspired by the death of weapons inspector and government scientist Dr. David Kelly. After acting as a whistle-blower and telling a journalist that he disagreed with claims the British government made about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, Kelly was found dead only days later. A Parliamentary committee investigated the death and determined it to be suicide, but many, including Thom, are skeptical of the validity of this inquiry. This is not the first time Thom and the band have infused their music with political meaning. Though, as he explains to Jim and Greg, his approach differs from that of his fellow countryman.

6 The album up for review this week is Loose, the third release from pop singer Nelly Furtado. Furtado had breakout success with her 2000 record Whoa, Nelly!, which featured the hit single, "I'm Like a Bird." The singer didn't have as much luck with her second album, Folklore, so on this go-around, she sought out acclaimed producer Timbaland to boost her sound. Our critics disagree as to whether or not she has succeeded. Jim explains that he finds her newly sexed out image manufactured and unoriginal. He misses her more adventurous approach to music that incorporated mainstream pop with worldbeat and folk. Basically Jim just finds Nelly to be a "skanky ho." That said, he does appreciate the Latin songs on the album, as well as the ballad she did with Coldplay's Chris Martin. For Greg, these are the worst songs on the album. Rather, he loves the irresistible dance songs like "Promiscuous" and "Maneater," which are filled with Timbaland's signature grooves. Greg questions why Jim is so upset by a woman being overtly sexual, and explains that he finds that content flirtatious, playful and ultimately, harmless. So, both critics give Loose a Burn It rating, though for very different reasons.

7 Jim's Desert Island Jukebox pick this week is inspired by his conversation with Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead. The band uses live performances as opportunities to explore and expand tracks they work on in the studio. This reminds Jim of the touring tactics of another great British band-Pink Floyd. They too would road-test songs for months at a time before taking them to the studio. And the result is similar. Both Radiohead and Pink Floyd are simultaneously experimental, avant-garde and also successful and mainstream-a rare thing in the music industry. So, the track Jim decides to adds to the jukebox is one Pink Floyd experimented with live, then later recorded in a different format. The song fans know as "Sheep" from their 1977 album Animals, was originally performed live as "Raving and Drooling." Listen to the studio version, then compare it to this rare DIJ pick.
