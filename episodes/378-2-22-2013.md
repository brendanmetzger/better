## News
1 Lady Gaga has cancelled her "Born This Way" tour due to a hip injury. (You can see her wheeling around Chicago post-surgery). Millions of little monsters will be deprived of 22 national shows. And the Gaga camp might be out $35 million. With all the dancing and acrobatics, it's surprising more pop artists aren't wiped out by injuries...gives Jim and Greg a new appreciation for Tina Turner.

2 In other concert news, Paul McCartney will be headlining the Bonnaroo Festival in Tennessee.  He'll be joined by Mumford and Sons and Tom Petty, but also Wu-Tang Clan and Nas-some surprising additions to the traditionally roots and jam festival. Concertgoers will also be excited to hear about the Firefly Festival's plans for its second year, including the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Kendrick Lamar. Here in Chicago, the Pitchfork Festival has booked Bjork and in perplexing move, controversial hometown boy R. Kelly.

3 During the last part of the news segment, Jim and Greg bid farewell to songwriter and producer Shadow Morton. He was instrumental in bringing the Shangri-Las to fame with hits like "Leader of the Pack" and "Remember" that compressed teen angst dramas into three-minute pop operas. And Shadow later worked with Janis Ian and The New York Dolls.

4 Just think of it as Sound Opinions' antidote to the Grammys: Buried Treasures. During this installment, Jim and Greg dig deep to bring you some hidden musical gems they think deserve wider notice. Here are their gems:

Jim
Foxygen, We Are the 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace & Magic
Spookeasy, Faux Show
Big Dipper, Big Dipper
Low Cut Connie, Call Me Sylvia

Greg
Indians, Somewhere Else  
Dawn Richard, Goldenheart  
Follakzoid, II
Gap Dream, Gap Dream

5 Nick Cave is a modern renaissance man-novelist, poet, actor, playwriting, and of course rocker. Now, with his band The Bad Seeds, he's released the ensemble's 15th album called Push the Sky Away. Greg is impressed with the scope of the lyrics-from the God Particle to Hannah Montana. This record is more introspective and more minimalist, and Greg says Buy It. Jim is disappointed and wishes the tracks were less monotonous and less quiet. He misses the punk explosion and can only recommend you Burn It.
