1 Greg's Mix: "2006: A Curse I Cannot Lift" - 17 Songs, 24 hours
Launch Greg's Mixtape

A mix tape of some of my favorite songs from 2006, sequenced to tell a story about a day in the life. 

1. Lindsey Buckingham, "I Am Waiting": A cover of a relatively obscure Rolling Stones track from "Aftermath" sets the mood of sun-rise expectation and apprehension. "I am waiting ... waiting for someone to come out of somewhere." 

2. Midlake, "Roscoe": An echo from Lindsey Buckingham's past? The sound is mid-'70s Fleetwood Mac: dusky folk-rock. I can imagine Christine McVie doing a perfect cover of this song. The song is set in 1891, like a dream about a more innocent time.

3. Decemberists, "The Crane Wife 3": Still in the past, still dreaming, but the innocence turns to despair.

4. Dirty on Purpose, "Car No-Drive": Wake up. Morning rush hour. This song sounds like it's pouring from the windows of a passing subway train. We're going somewhere...

5. Rhymefest, "Bullet": To Iraq. Turn on the TV, and we see young recruits wondering how they ended up in a desert in the Middle East fighting a war they don't understand.

6. Serena-Maneesh, "Drain Cosmetics": A sandstorm of guitars.

7. Secret Machines, "Lightning Blue Eyes": Then tunneling out, and into the sunlight where "I felt awake, I was way out"

8. Parts and Labor, "A Great Divide": A call to arms, a dividing line in the mix, day becomes night. 

9. TV on the Radio, "Wolf Like Me": Silhouettes dash against the moon --- "Got a curse I cannot lift" 

10. Roots, "In the Music": A sinister night vibe, as low-riders slink through skyscraper canyons.

11. Nelly Furtado, "Maneater": Where all sorts of nightcrawlers roam ...

12. Justin Timberlake, "What Goes Around/Comes Around": And a reckoning goes down --- "I can't believe it's ending this way."

13. Van Hunt, "If I Take You Home": The night winds down, uneasy partners match up....

14. Love is All, "Make Out Fall Out Make Up": The hangover aftermath ---"I think I'll spend all day in bed"

15. Gnarls Barkley, "Gone Daddy Gone": "Love is gone away."

16. John Legend, "Show Me": A morning prayer for guidance

17. Beyonce, "Irreplaceable": And she's ready to move on, a new day begins...
