## News
1 Music legend Ike Turner passed away a couple of weeks ago, so Jim and Greg took this opportunity to discuss how much this controversial figure influenced the development of rock and roll. Most people's image of Turner is taken from the 1993 movie What's Love Got to Do With It, which portrayed his violent relationship with Tina Turner. But, as is the case with countless artists and musicians, even bad people can make great art. Turner was a major music figure long before he met Tina, and many people say that his 1951 recording of "Rocket 88" led to the birth of rock and roll. Listen to the song, and check out Greg's obituary of the musician.

2 Mary J. Blige is back with a new album that's getting lots of attention. Growing Pains is the R&B diva's 8th album in a career that has seen 6 Grammy Awards and 40 million records sold. So how does this effort compare? Jim thinks that Blige may have lost some of her edge-whether that's due to sunnier times or sunnier production isn't clear though. She's known for her honest and emotional performances which often relay tough times. But Jim finds Growing Pains a little too sterile. He gives it a Burn It. Greg admits that he too was worried about how a happier MJB would sound, but he disagrees with Jim's conclusion. As a singer she has no peer, and Greg thinks she's gotten even better. He calls Growing Pains another landmark Blige record and gives it a Buy It.
