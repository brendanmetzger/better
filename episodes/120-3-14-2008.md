## News
1 Jim and Greg kick off the show with a discussion of some of the best and worst campaign songs in presidential history. Check out this list and decide which have been the most successful. Certainly Michael Dukakis could've made a better choice. And, Jim and Greg wonder what left-leaning Woody Guthrie would've thought of George H.W. Bush's appropriation of "This Land Is Your Land." Also, while he hasn't embraced it as an official campaign song, Barack Obama inspired this Will.I.Am track. Jim is a fan of the Black Eyed Peas member and producer, but even he won't be voting for this song.

2 This week Jim and Greg speak with Butch Vig. The Wisconsin-based producer has worked on some of the most notable records in the past two decades including Siamese Dream by the Smashing Pumpkins, Dirty by Sonic Youth and Nevermind by Nirvana. In addition, he's a founding member and drummer for the band Garbage.

3 The Baltimore duo Beach House has a new album out called Devotion. This is the indie pop band's second effort, and they are back with a slow, dreamy sound that many compare to Mazzy Star and Galaxie 500. Jim and Greg agree-this is definitely a sound they've heard before, and much better. Greg says Devotion is a one-tempo album and challenges anyone to differentiate one track from the other. Jim agrees and can't understand why the band is getting such hype. The Beach House album gets two Trash Its.

4 Goldfrapp is another duo with a new album out called Seventh Tree. The British electronic act formed in 1999, and since then Jim and Greg have disagreed on each album, including 2006's Supernature. Now it seems they are destined to disagree once again. Goldfrapp has returned to its bucolic, trip-folk roots and Greg is happy to hear it. He appreciates their orchestration and lead singer Allison Goldfrapp's voice and gives Seventh Tree a Burn It. Jim admits that recently he's been dissing duos a lot on the show, but he can't recommend this album. He finds it completely boring and gives a Trash It rating.
