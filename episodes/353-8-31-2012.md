DIJ: Jim

Jim’s been thinking a lot about Genesis lately – and no, not the most famous version of the band with Phil Collins on vocals. Before hits like “I Can’t Dance ” Genesis was an unabashedly nerdy prog rock band, and that’s the iteration of the group Jim wants to celebrate with his DIJ pick. 1971’s Nursery Cryme with Peter Gabriel on vocals fit wonderfully into Jim’s teenage world of renaissance fairs, Isaac Asimov, and Dungeons and Dragons. No track embodied the group’s proto-steampunk ethic better than “The Return of the Giant Hogweed.” Gabriel tells the story of a Victorian explorer who discovers the hogweed in Russia. Unaware of the plant’s carnivorous tendencies he brings it back to England to the royal Kew Gardens, where it proceeds to wreak havoc. Listen for Steve Hackett, mimicking the sounds of the murderous plant on his guitar.
