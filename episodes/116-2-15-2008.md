## News
1 Jim and Greg don't like to give too much airtime to the Grammy Awards, but there was one upset worth mentioning (other than Amy Winehouse not getting a visa). Beating out big names like Winehouse, Kanye West, the Foo Fighters and Vince Gill for Album of the Year was veteran jazz musician Herbie Hancock. Hancock is a critically acclaimed pianist who many listeners will remember for composing the 1983 jazz-hip hop fusion track "Rockit." But, according to Greg, this is a case of "right artist, wrong year." Hancock's winning album River: The Joni Letters is by no means the musician's finest work. With the exception of the one track on which Joni Mitchell sings, most of the songs have unsuccessful vocals. Greg gives this "muzak" album a Burn It. Jim calls River a "stultifyingly mediocre record" that isn't a fair representation of the year in music. The Recording Academy might give the album an award, but he gives it a Trash It.

2a Before Jim and Greg launch into their discussion of the best movie soundtracks of all time, they review the soundtrack that's currently getting the most buzz. Juno, the little movie that could, is not only a success at the box office, but with music consumers as well. The soundtrack became the first Rhino record to hit #1 on the Billboard chart, and it was even able to topple Alicia Keys' recent release.

2b The success of the Juno soundtrack is surprising considering how obscure many of the songs are. The album is dominated by tracks from The Moldy Peaches and its former lead singer Kimya Dawson. The success is also surprising to Jim because, well...he hates it. He's gone on record as not liking the movie, but Jim also thinks the album is completely unsuccessful. He finds Dawson's songwriting amateurish and childish gives the soundtrack a big Trash It. Greg agrees, explaining that it doesn't seem like Dawson knows the difference between childlike and childish, or between cute and cloying. He says Juno is really tough to listen to and also gives the soundtrack a Trash It rating.
