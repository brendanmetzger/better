## News
1 Britney Spears isn't a schoolgirl anymore. At seven albums in she's a record industry veteran, which begs the question - is she over? Her latest Femme Fatale debuted at #1, but with only 276,000 copies sold. That's nothing compared to people like Taylor Swift and Eminem. And as Jim and Greg add, where does Britney fit in when you have Katy Perry on one end of the pop spectrum and Lady Gaga on the other? They also wonder where she fits in on her album, one that has 28 songwriters and 13 producers. It's a well-oiled machine, and a very well-produced one. But Britney is almost incidental. Jim calls Femme Fatale soulless and gives it a Trash It rating. Greg doesn't argue with this, but recommends listeners Burn It just to hear the top notch production.

2 No matter what bracket you are in, no one likes paying taxes. Nothing makes things more tolerable, though, than great music. So, Jim and Greg have compiled the perfect playlist for Tax Day:

Greg
T. Bone Burnett, "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"
Fenton Robinson, "Somebody Loan Me a Dime"
Wu-Tang Clan, "C.R.E.A.M."
Barrett Strong, The Beatles, Flying Lizard: "Money (That's What I Want)"

Jim
The Beatles, "Taxman"
The Kinks, "Sunny Afternoon"
Johnny Cash, "After Taxes"
Abba, "Money, Money, Money"

3 After taking a small hiatus (and moving to film), TV on the Radio is back with its fourth album. The Brooklyn art rockers are one of the best bands to come out in the last decade, according to Jim and Greg. Nine Types of Light is a more optimistic, ballad heavy album, which normally Greg wouldn't say is the kind of record for him. But it's so layered and substantive that he says definitely Buy It. Jim puts them up there with Radiohead, and compares the subtle rhythms on this release to that on King of Limbs. He also praises the singing. Nine Types of Light gets two types of Buy Its.
