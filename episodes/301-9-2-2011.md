## News
1 Despite the fact that most musicians spend their lives avoiding a "real job," there are a number of great songs about the drudgery and the glory of hard work. During this Labor Day episode Jim and Greg play their favorite Songs About Work.

Greg
The Animals, "We Gotta Get Out of This Place" 
Van Morrison, "Cleaning Windows"
Bob Marley, "Night Shift"
The Jam, "Smithers-Jones"

Jim
John Lennon, "Working Class Hero"
The Clash, "Career Opportunities"
Lou Reed, "Don't Talk to Me About Work"
The Flaming Lips, "Bad Days"

2 Once fresh faces in the frat punk world, the Red Hot Chili Peppers are a heritage act at this point. Their 10th album I'm With You is one of many collaborations with superproducer Rick Rubin. And it's the first with new guitarist Josh Klinghoffer. Lead singer Anthony Kiedis considers this a reboot, but Greg's having a hard time buying their new identity as a stadium ballad band. He misses the guitar virtuosity of John Frusciante, who quit in 2009. Flea remains an all-star bass player, but he can't save I'm With You. Greg says Trash It. Jim agrees with that sentiment, pointing to the lousy, mush-mouthed lyrics of Kiedis as his primary hurdle. This is not a sensitive band, and he would welcome a return to funk rock. Until then...Trash It.

3 Lil Wayne is fresh out of Rikers with the 4th album in his Tha Carter series. But curiously, he doesn't give much time to his jail experience. For the past decade, he's been one of the most successful rappers in the business, both with his releases and mixtapes, but also as an ever-present cameo fixture. Jim describes Weezy as an interesting producer, but he can't get over the hip-hop clich'es. Tell us about prison, he pleads. Without those insights, this is a Trash It album. Greg was surprised to find that the most interesting rapping on Tha Carter IV was not by Lil Wayne himself. Rather, guests like Andre 3000, Tech 9 and Busta Rhymes take the prize. So for those tracks alone, Greg says Burn It.
