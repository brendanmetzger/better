## News
1 First up in the news is Billboard's annual list of the year's biggest money makers in the music industry. The chart magazine compiled the list using CD and digital sales, publishing royalties and touring. And while most of the artists at the top still sell records, the majority made the cut because of their hugely successful blockbuster tours. At #1 is U2, who raked in more than $108 million in 2009, mostly through their gigantic 360-degree tour. The band is followed by Bruce Springsteen and Madonna, though a number of younger acts also made the cut including The Jonas Brothers and Taylor Swift. Two glaring omissions: Beyonce and the Black Eyed Peas, neither of which toured in 2009.

2 In more Billboard news, Sade is at the top of the charts for the third week in a row with her new release Soldier of Love. She's sold over 800,000 records. Jim and Greg were interested to see so many adult-skewing artists on the charts, including Johnny Cash and Susan Boyle. It's the older consumers that are continuing to purchase physical product. However, they note that these sales numbers wouldn't have gotten you into the Top 50 ten years ago.

3 This week's feature celebrates an important, albeit struggling medium: Radio. Last year radio revenue fell 18%, perhaps signaling its worst year ever. And the industry overseas isn't immune. Even powerhouse BBC has been facing tough economic times. But, while bands have many other methods of promotion and distribution these days, radio airplay still gives a significant boost to record sales. And musicians are now looking to radio performances as another source of revenue. Jim and Greg both fondly remember discovering new bands on their FM dials. To honor that legacy, they play these great Radio-Inspired Tracks:

Jim
Wall of Voodoo, "Mexican Radio" 
R.E.M., "Radio Free Europe" 
Donna Summer, "On the Radio"
Nirvana, "Radio Friendly Unit Shifter"

Greg 
ZZ Top, "Heard it on the X"
The Replacements, "Left of the Dial"
Indeep, "Last Night a DJ Saved My Life"
Public Enemy, "How to Kill a Radio Consultant"

4 While he won't be joining his former Genesis bandmates at the upcoming Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony, Peter Gabriel will be busy promoting his new album Scratch My Back. Gabriel graduated from Genesis to have a hugely successful solo pop career. Now he's tackling some of his favorite songs on this new covers' record. Greg has immense respect for Gabriel, and thinks the album concept, which focuses on melodies and lyrics, is a noble one. However for him, it loses steam and lacks any variety. He gives this "well-intentioned dud" a Trash It. Jim doesn't understand Greg's criticism about tempo, and points out that this is a mood record. He applauds Gabriel for taking a left turn at 60 and gives Scratch My Back a Buy It.
