A message from Jim: 
The following, LISTED IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER, is my tally of albums mid-year in 2009 that have all warranted 3.5 stars or more on the Chicago Sun-Times' 4-star ratings scale (making them all very enthusiastic "buy its" on the "Sound Opinions" scale). I will mention that these are in no particular order (sorry, but that's reserved for the year-end list), that this list is not all-inclusive (I will no doubt catch up with quite a few discs released earlier in the year by the time I tally the year-end list) and, also, because this always confuses people, THESE ARE IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER. Yet. But they're all really, really, really good albums.-JIM

2 Moby has a new album out called Wait for Me. The musician has spent a decade trying to follow-up the success of his 1999 album Play. And if his last record was a night out on the town, this is the comedown for Greg. He recorded it at home, and you can hear that sense of isolation. Greg's only quibble is the length, so he gives it a Buy It. Jim agrees. He hears the newly independent artist connecting with his roots, again taking inspiration from David Lynch. Moby gets a double Buy It.

3 Rockford, IL's own Cheap Trick have been making music for four decades. So, you wouldn't expect much from them now, right? But, as Jim says, these "geezers" are fierce. He calls them one of the hardest working bands in show business, and says they still have the goods on stage and in the studio. He gives The Latest a Buy It. Greg hears Cheap Trick taking risks again, and states that any band with Bunny Carlos as drummer is great. He also gives the album a Buy It rating.
