## Guests
Steve Wynn and the Miracle Three

## News
1 Jim and Greg begin the show with a discussion of Lollapalooza and other summer festivals. There is Coachella in California and Bonnaroo in Tennessee, but Chicago is shaping up to be the major destination for music fans this year. This year's Lollapalooza lineup is impressive with a diverse mix of bands including Lolla vets The Flaming Lips and Red Hot Chili Peppers, indie favorites Death Cab for Cutie and The Shins, and Chicago natives Wilco and Kanye West. In addition, the city will be home to two of the biggest independent music festivals: The Pitchfork Music Festival, featuring Destroyer, Art Brut, Spoon and post-punk pioneers Mission of Burma, and the Intonation Music Festival featuring The Streets, Bloc Party, Lupe Fiasco and a rare appearance by 13th Floor Elevators founder Roky Erickson.

2 In preparation for the show's guest, Steve Wynn, Jim and Greg do a little primer on the Paisley Underground music scene that developed in California in the 1980s. Before getting into the discussion, Jim plays a song by one of the seminal bands of this scene-The 3 O'Clock whose very psychedelic name was inspired by Tom Wolfe's assertion in The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test that if one drops acid in the early evening, the high of the trip will occur at 3:00 a.m. The 3 O'Clock was helmed by Michael Quercio, a musician who started as a punk rocker. After discovering psychedelic rock, however, his sound, and his look, began to change. It was Cuercio's affinity for the music of the 60s, as well as the brightly colored paisley clothes, that gave this scene its name. While the name did not do the music justice, the influence of the Paisley Underground on contemporary bands like Oasis and The Secret Machines is undeniable.

3 While this may be surprising to listeners who are only familiar with "Walk Like an Egyptian," The Bangles were also pioneers of the Paisley Underground. Their original sound, with its 3 and 4 part harmonies and sing-songy melodies, paralleled that of the Mamas and the Papas and The Byrds. Lead singer Susanna Hoffs continues to work in this genre; she and 90's indie pop star Matthew Sweet just released a 1960's covers album featuring songs by The Left Banke, The Beach Boys and The Who.

4 Greg points out that the Paisley Underground sound is not a homogenous one. What bonded these bands, however, was a punk sensibility that was more inclusive to other musical styles. Unlike many other punk bands at the time, these musical acts didn't see why they had to conform to a strict policy of 3 minute, Ramones-style songs. And what's more punk rock than non-conformity? One of the bands that took its punk rock and psychedelic rock influences to a new place is the Long Ryders. They took more of a country take and can be seen as pioneers of the alternative country scene that is now a home to bands like Uncle Tupelo, Son Volt and the Bottle Rockets.

5 The Rain Parade is the next Paisley Underground band up for discussion. While the members of The Rain Parade never had major label success like their peers in the 3 O'Clock (who were signed to Prince's Paisley Park label) or The Bangles, many went on to be a part of successful projects. David Robeck formed the band Mazzy Star, who had an alternative hit single with "Fade Into You" in 1993 and Matt Piucci went on to work with Crazy Horse. The remaining bandmates reincarnated themselves as Viva Saturn.

6 To take us into the break, Greg chooses to play a song featuring this week's guest, Steve Wynn. His band The Dream Syndicate was a band that both Jim and Greg became fans of in the early 80's. They emerged in LA as one of the pioneers of the Paisley Underground sound. Steve then released a number of solo records and has spent the last few years with his most recent band, The Miracle 3. Steve and his band members, Linda Pitmon, Dave DeCastro and Kirk Swan, joined Jim and Greg for an interview and performance at the Chicago Recording Company.

7 The Dream Syndicate never made it into the 1990's, but the band's sound was quite influential and innovative. Other LA bands at the time, like Black Flag, Social Distortion and Bad Religion, were making post-punk and punk music with a really hard edge, The Dream Syndicate stuck to a swirlier, psychedelic pop sound. For this reason, Jim and Greg explain, no matter how many solo projects he embarks on, our guest will most likely always be remembered as the lead singer of The Dream Syndicate. 

8 After playing a track from Days of Wine and Roses, which Greg earlier referred to as one of the masterpieces of that Paisley Underground era, our host asks Steve about the chemistry between two guitarists. In this case, Steve's partner in guitar is Kirk Swan, who was in another innovative 80's indie pop band, Dumptruck, Steve responds that the basic formula of playing guitar, along with drums and bass, is simple, but never gets old. He points to bands like Neil Young and Crazy Horse and Television as examples.

9 Jim asks Steve about why he continues on in this business after so many years. As Steve jokes on his website, this new album is one of many "comebacks," but music is not such an easy life to come back to. After being pegged the "new Springsteen," Steve and the band had somewhat of a difficult time. He explains how that hurt the band (and indirectly how he hurt Jim one drunken night). Thankfully they both came out the other side.

10 The first album up for review this week is the The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living, the 3rd album from British rapper The Streets. Emcee Mike Skinner first caught the attention of American fans with his debut album Original Pirate Material and its hit single "Let's Push Things Forward." Its follow-up, A Grand Don't Come for Free achieved a lot of critical and commercial success. In fact, it was one of the top albums of 2004 for Greg and many of the staff at Sound Opinions H.Q. People familiar with these albums will know Skinner's rap identity is that of the average bloke. He pairs stories of daily life in England with chintzy beats. With this album, however, Skinner can hardly think of himself as the everyman. The narratives in these songs poke fun at his pop star status and all the pitfalls of fame. While Jim and Greg find this new take funny, they don't find it as emotionally poignant. Therefore, it's a Burn It from Jim, and a surprising Trash It from Greg.

11 R&B/Soul singer Van Hunt also has a new album out. His 2004 self-titled debut album was very well-received. Listeners could hear the funk influences of bands like Sly Stone and Curtis Mayfield, as well as the more romantic, slow jams of singers like Marvin Gaye or D'Angelo. With a pimp for a father and a nurturing caregiver as a mother, Greg muses that these musical influences parallel Van Hunt's own familial influences. On this album, On the Jungle Floor, Van Hunt stretches himself more. He makes the surprising choice to cover "No Sense of Crime," a punk classic by The Stooges. And, fans will hear the influence of yet another R&B/funk idol-Prince. However, both Jim and Greg assert that with this release, the grasshopper has surpassed the master, and rate On the Jungle Floor higher than Prince's new album 3121. It's a Buy It for both critics.

12 The show concludes with another addition to the Desert Island Jukebox. This week it is Mr. DeRogatis' turn. He ties the show up nicely with his selection from the band Dumptruck. One of Dumptruck's founders, Kirk Swan, played with Steve Wynn during the segment. He and his partner, Seth Tiven, put out their debut album, D is for Dumptruck, in 1994 and were very influenced by what Paisley Underground bands like The Dream Syndicate were doing on the west coast. Dumptruck incorporated more folk rock and power pop into their music, however, and were also influenced by Big Star, Fairport Convention (who also count Greg Kot and Sound Opinions guest Colin Meloy as fans), and the band Television. Like Dumptruck, Television was also comprised of two guitarists and vocalists-Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd. Jim explains that other than Television, he has never seen two guitarists work so well together as they did in Dumptruck. A great example of this is Jim's DIJ pick-"Alive." Listeners desirous of more Dumptruck are recommended to check out Haul of Fame: A Collection, for which our host provided the liner notes.

## Recurring Segments
DIJ: Jim

This week it is Mr. DeRogatis’ turn to drop a quarter in the DIJ. He ties the show up nicely with his selection from the band Dumptruck. One of Dumptruck’s founders, Kirk Swan, played with Steve Wynn during the segment. He and his partner, Seth Tiven, put out their debut album, D is for Dumptruck, in 1994 and were very influenced by what Paisley Underground bands like The Dream Syndicate were doing on the west coast. Dumptruck incorporated more folk rock and power pop into their music, however, and were also influenced by Big Star, Fairport Convention (who also count Greg Kot and Sound Opinions guest Colin Meloy as fans), and the band Television. Like Dumptruck, Television was also comprised of two guitarists and vocalists—Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd. Jim explains that other than Television, he has never seen two guitarists work so well together as they did in Dumptruck. A great example of this is Jim’s DIJ pick—“Alive.”
