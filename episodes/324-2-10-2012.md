## News
1 Being such romantics, our hosts love to do Valentine's Day shows. However, sometimes the themes are less than romantic-Unconventional Love or Love Stinks. But this year is all about the sweet, innocent and sometimes terrifying feelings of First Love. Here are their tracks:

Jim
The Police, "Walking on the Moon"
The Partridge Family featuring David Cassidy, "I Think I Love You"
Avant & Keke Wyatt, "My First Love"
Neil Young, "Farmer John"

Greg
Tommy James & The Shondells, "I Think We're Alone Now"
Art Brut, "Emily Kane"
The Shirelles, "Will You Love Me Tomorrow"
Air, "Playground Love"

2 Jim and Greg share the love, literally, and invite some listeners to play guest critic. Here are the songs that remind them of First Love.

Whitney in Chicago: Sonic Youth, "Little Trouble Girl"
Sam in Seattle: The Spinners, "Working My Way Back to You"
Chris in Chicago: Concrete Blonde, "Scene of a Perfect Crime"
Kathy in Portland: Big Star, "Thirteen"

3 Whether you've been watching Saturday Night Live or reading the Wall Street Journal, you have heard of Lana Del Rey. She's been a lightening rod for a number of conversations about marketing and feminism. But Jim and Greg are happy to look past all those debates and focus on the music. Unfortunately, this self-proclaimed "Gangsta Nancy Sinatra" isn't wowing them on her new release Born to Die. Jim describes Del Rey as a combination of Julee Cruise and Lily Allen, however she doesn't have the vocal chops or the sense of humor of either. Worse than her narrow range, however, is her lack of passion and believability. Jim says Trash It. Greg loves the production by industry veteran David Kahne. But the songs are very "samey" and full of clich'es. He also can't abide by her passive nature, so Greg can only say Burn It.
