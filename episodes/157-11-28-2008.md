## News
1 A few months ago Jim and Greg reported that the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals had tossed out the FCC's indecency claim against CBS. We thought that might be the end of "Nipplegate," but now the FCC has announced it will take its case to the Supreme Court. Jim and Greg never thought they'd find themselves agreeing with CBS, but it agrees with the network's argument that sometimes there are just some slips you can't control.

2 One of the albums making news this week is from rapper Kanye West. The Chicago native had planned to release a new album in his college series, but after the death of his mother and a bad breakup, he created an intensely personal album called 808s and Heartbreaks. The 808 drum machine is used heavily, as is the Auto-Tune device. Those effects take some getting used to, but according to Jim and Greg, they are integral to creating the sense of introspection and loneliness. Jim appreciates the rapper's attempt to make an existential record, especially one inspired by Phil Collins. He wishes there was more acoustic musicianship, but Jim finds 808s and Heartbreak to be fascinating and gives it a Buy It. Greg agrees, calling the album one of the most personal released this year. He also gives it a Buy It.

3 On Thanksgiving most Americans give thanks for things like their loved ones and their health. But at Sound Opinions we like to take this opportunity to give thanks of a different variety. During this Turkey Shoot segment Jim, Greg and some listeners give thanks that they'll never have to hear the year's most disappointing albums again. These are records that had great potential, but fell flat. Say farewell to the following Turkeys:

R.E.M., Accelerate
My Morning Jacket, Evil Urges
Brian Wilson, That Lucky Old Sun
The Raconteurs, Consolers of the Lonely

Our listeners "shoot" the following:
Weezer, S/T (The Red Album)
John Legend, Evolver
Beck, Modern Guilt

4 On their 3rd album Day & Age, The Killers have teamed up with Madonna producer Stuart Price, further confusing their identity. Are they Nu-New Wave? Are they Nu-Springsteen? Or Nu-Dance Pop? Greg's answer is that they are merely a great singles band. Brandon Flowers is not a great lyricist, but there are a handful of great, glam rock pop songs on this new album, and together with the handful of other tracks from their previous albums, he predicts they'll have a hell of a compilation one day. But for now he gives Day & Age a Burn It. Jim is less kind. He finds the album over-produced and packed with the worst steel drums and saxophones he's heard in a long time. He gives it a Trash It.

5 The Weezer album might have gotten a Turkey vote from one of our listeners, but how does front man Rivers Cuomo fare on his own? The singer just released Alone II: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo, and according to Jim and Greg it's full of the heartfelt, intimate songs that fans of the Blue Album expect from Cuomo. Greg sees Weezer's recent songs as being written for the masses, while these are written from the heart. Whatever your take on Weezer is, both Jim and Greg give a Buy It to The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo.
