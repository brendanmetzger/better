## News
1 When candy, flowers, and love notes fail to woo your sweetie back, there’s only one thing left to do: stake out under a window, hold up that boom box and blast an “I Want You Back” song. This Valentine’s Day, Jim and Greg present their favorite Pleading Songs.

Jim
Rod Stewart, “You’re in My Heart (The Final Acclaim)"
Mudhoney, “If I Think”
Yvonne Elliman, “If I Can’t Have You”
Simple Minds, “Don’t You (Forget About Me)”

Greg
Al Green, “Can’t Get Next to You”
The Spinners, “Working My Way Back to You"
Bonnie Raitt, “Love Has No Pride”
Alex Chilton, “Can’t Seem to Make You Mine” 

2 Jim and Greg pass the mic to some of the expert beggers in the audience. We hear some listeners’ suggestions for great “I Want You Back” tracks:
                                      
Heather in Chesterton, IN 
Stranger Cole and Ken Booth, “Uno, Dos, Tres” 
Alex in Portland, OR
Dawes, “Coming Back to a Man"
Matthew in Portland, ME 
Aretha Franklin, “Don’t Let Me Lose This Dream” 
Kathy & John in Raleigh, NC 
Paul Young, "Come Back and Stay” & Trio, “Out in the Streets"

3 We highlighted My Bloody Valentine in our Shoegaze genre dissection a few weeks ago, and after 21 years of scattered promises, it seemed to be a pretty safe bet that a 3rd MBV album would never see the light of day. But then on February 2, 2013, mbv was quietly released on their website. Is it even possible for the band to escape from the long shadow of their legendary sophomore album Loveless? Greg says not quite. He thinks that the first few songs rehash Loveless’ glory, but don’t meet its standard. The second half shows the band moving into the future. He anxiously awaits that future, but in the meantime, mbv is a Burn It. Jim thinks the band lost momentum during this two decade hiatus. And while it is no Loveless, mbv is much better than he feared it would be. He gives the record a Buy It.
