## News
1 The Michael Jackson posthumous money grab has begun. The new single "This Is It" has been released. It's likely to be the final new piece of music from the King of Pop and coincides with the release of a greatest hits album and movie of the same name. The film captures Jackson's L.A. rehearsals for what was to be his comeback tour. Greg saw This Is It earlier this week and describes it as a first hand glimpse of the artist in his final days. Greg was surprised to see how sharp and detail-oriented Jackson was, especially considering his frail appearance. Jackson lost some of his voice, but still knew how to make great theater, and Greg believes this comeback attempt would've been a success.

2 Next in the news, another successful rapper is headed for prison. Lil Wayne, the number one selling artist of 2008, pled guilty to gun possession and is expected to be sentenced to a year in prison. He has a new mixtape out this week and will likely continue releasing and promoting music throughout next year-especially if he follows the lead of T.I. That rapper is serving a prison sentence he began in May and is not only still a Billboard Top 200 seller, but recently won a BET award.
