## News
1 Frequent concertgoers know that with the good (music and merriment) comes the bad, especially during the summer high season. Just last week news broke about a stage collapse at the Indiana State Fair Sugarland performance, where 5 were killed and dozens more injured. That was a tragedy no one could have predicted. But some incidents at shows are merely the result of bad behavior on the part of fans: drinking, drugs, violence and more. And this is a bummer not just for fans, but for artists who depend on touring revenue for their bread and butter and often risk being banned from markets or venues. So what's a rocker to do? John Jurgensen of the Wall Street Journal wrote about the idea of the "Fan Code of Conduct," and he talks to Jim and Greg about how performers and fans are working together to make the concert world a better place.

2 In music, like other things, sometimes it's easy for the little guy to get overlooked. So every once in a while Jim and Greg dig into their chest of musical treasures to unearth some records that deserve more attention. These Buried Treasures aren't household names, but are worth adding to your collection.

Jim
Cave, Neverendless
Shabazz Palaces, Black Up
Washed Out, Within and Without
Ty Segall, Goodbye Bread

Greg
Antietam, Tenth Life
Kings Go Forth, The Outsiders Are Back
Eleventh Dream Day, Riot Now!
Sam Phillips, Solid State

3 Veteran singer/songwriter John Hiatt has a new album out called Dirty Jeans and Mudslide Hymns. And like your favorite jeans, there's something comfortable about Hiatt. But, Jim adds, there's also great depth and poignancy. Just look at the variety of artists who choose to cover Hiatt. He says Buy It. Greg describes Hiatt as amazingly consistent over the years. You can count on a handful of Americana classics sung with a wolfish drawl. But Dirty Jeans is neither great nor terrible. He wishes Hiatt had pushed it further and would recommend you Burn It.
