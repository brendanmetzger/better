DIJ: Greg

This week, Greg dropped a quarter in the Desert Island Jukebox, and brought the heavy lumber. His choice, was Gloria Jones's, Tainted Love. That's right, Gloria Jones, not Soft Cell. Soft Cell covered this "Northern Soul" classic, and received loads of cash and airplay, but this version is where it all started. Greg also blew Jim's mind, when he told Jim that Gloria was the wife of Marc Bolan, of T-Rex fame. Bolan died in a car crash, and Gloria was the driver in the car.
