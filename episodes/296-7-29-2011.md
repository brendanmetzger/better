## News
1 What if you could predict a hit? It's a music industry dream (or nightmare depending on how you look at it.) New research from Emory University suggests that the answers might lie in our brains. Dr. Gregory Berns and his team have discovered that teens have tell-tale brain responses when listening to hit songs, and that could help predict a song's commercial success. He explains to Jim and Greg that the discovery was an accident. After conducting MRI studies on teens listening to MySpace music, he noted that one of the tracks, One Republic's "Apologize" became an American Idol hit years later. Strong activity in two brain regions could predict hits about 1/3 of the time. Weak activity was even better at predicting non-hits. And brain responses in those regions were better predictors of song success than whether the participants said they liked or disliked any given song. Jim and Greg aren't teens, but wonder if their work could be made easier with MRI technology.

2 Like peas and carrots, and Jim and Greg, some things are better in twos. That especially goes for voices. There's something special about a great Duet, so this week our own duo play their favorites.
