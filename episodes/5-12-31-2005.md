DIJ: Greg

Greg Kot’s DIJ selection for this week is “A Woman Needs to be Loved” by Tyrone Davis. Greg notes that three great soul singers died in 2005; Eugene Record, Luther Vandross, and Tyrone Davis, with Tyrone being the most overlooked and versatile of the three. Greg points out that you can hear the resentment and pain in Tyrone's voice, over the knowledge that he was wrong, and this pain, sets this track aside as the standout in his discography.
