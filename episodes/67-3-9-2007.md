## News
1 In the music news this week is the announcement that four major radio corporations accused of practicing payola have agreed to a settlement with the FCC. In addition to paying the government $12.5 million, they will provide free commercial radio airtime for independent labels and local artists. Jim and Greg talk to Jenny Toomey and Michael Bracy of the Future of Music Coalition about the settlement and whether this will actually make a dent in payola. Both Toomey and Bracy admit that payola has been around forever, and is part of larger issues the music industry needs to tackle, but they're happy these steps are being taken. Jim and Greg also hear thoughts from the heads of several independent labels. You'll hear from Jim Powers of Minty Fresh Records, Bettina Richards of Thrill Jockey Records and Peter Gordon of Thristy Ear Recordings. Each label head expresses a mix of skepticism and optimism, and speaks to the question of whether or not indie labels even need commercial radio anymore. Jim and Greg get the last word and explain that payola, like a cockroach, will probably find a way to survive.
