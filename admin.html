## Stefan Wermelin
For as long as we can recall, the music industry story has been a sad one. But perhaps, there’s a happy ending? It has taken 13 years, but music revenues are finally up, albeit by 3%. But that’s still cause for celebration. Looks like digital music has been a big boost to the record biz, with its contribution to 30% of sales. And who was selling? Well, no surprises here: {artist: Adele} and {artist: Carly Rae Jepsen} are the reigning queens.

## Record Industry Stuff
This week the Center for Copyright Information, which includes members of the {tag: RIAA}, {tag: MPA} and many ISP’s, will begin to alert users engaged in illegal activity like piracy. The system hopes to be educational, rather than punitive. So, after “six strikes,” or alerts, a user may lose internet speed or be forced to watch videos about piracy. Will this be enough to curb a commonplace practice? We dunno, but here’s a video to tell you more. And please note the exits to your right and left.

## World things
Jim and Greg have always insisted that {genre: rock ‘n’ roll} belongs to the world. In our new series, the Sound Opinions World Tour, they prove it by zeroing in on countries that’ve made big contributions to global {genre: rock} and {genre: pop}. Their first stop is the largest exporter of music per capita in the world: {place: Sweden}. Swedish {tag: DJ} and public radio host {name: Stefan Wermelin} is our guide through the country’s musical history. Stefan explains that in the {era: ‘50s} and {era: ‘60s}, Sweden was a pop music backwater. Musicians churned out cut-rate covers of American and English hits. The ‘60s hippie “Progg” movement injected some originality and artistic ambition into Swedish music, but things didn’t really change until ABBA hit it big with “Waterloo.” According to Stefan, ABBA set the template for Swedish success. The band created big hits by co-opting the best bits of global pop music and stitching them together with meticulous production. That tradition of pastiche continues today with Swedish producers like Max Martin, the man behind a hundred-and-one Billboard Top Ten hits ({artist: Britney Spears}’ “…{track: Baby One More Time}” and {name: Kelly Clarkson}’s “Since U Been Gone” among them). But today, Sweden’s also experiencing an indie renaissance in genres as varied as death metal, dance music, and Americana. Decades after ABBA, artists like The Knife,Lykke Li, {artist: Robyn}, {artist: Opeth}, and {artist: First Aid Kit} are staging a second Swedish invasion. Check out our Sweden Playlist, inspired by this week’s show, on Spotify.

## What Thom Yorke is up to
After his solo project {album: The Eraser}, {tag: Radiohead} frontman {name: Thom Yorke} went out on tour with a group that could only be described as “super”: {artist: Red Hot Chili Peppers}’ {name: Flea} on bass, Radiohead {tag: producer} {name: Nigel Godrich} on programming, {name: Joey Waronker} on {tag: drums} and {name: Mauro Refosco} on {tag: percussion}. The collaboration worked so well that the group has released an album under the name Atoms for Peace. Greg was impressed with how The Eraser really found its identity live, and he has high hopes AMOK will do the same. But on record, the songs are not as strong as the production, so he can only say Burn It. In terms of his unique voice, Thom Yorke has finally won Jim over. He gets the robotic and alien nature of the voice the {genre: electronic} musicianship and the dystopian lyrics and says {tag: Buy It}.

{name: Miles Davis} has been on Greg’s mind lately, and his revolutionary string of early {era: ‘70s} albums(including {album: Bitches Brew}, {album: Live-Evil}, and On the Corner) have been fixtures on Greg’s turntable for weeks. Miles’ rock and funk explorations can be partially credited to (or blamed on, depending on your point of view) his then wife, Betty Davis. She put out her own series of great records after their divorce. For his Desert Island Jukebox pick this week, Greg turns to the first song on {name: Betty Davis}’ {era: 1973} self-titled {tag: debut}, “{track: If I’m in Luck I Might Get Picked Up}.” Betty put together an incredible band of {artist: Santana} and {artist: Sly Stone} sidemen (including {name: Larry Graham} on {tag: bass}!), and wrote parts for them that contained more than enough grit and grime to complement her raspy {genre: blues} roar and bawdy lyrics. Even {artist: Prince} personally told Greg that he uses this song as a frequent source of inspiration!
