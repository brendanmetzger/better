[{"Date":"3.1.2013","Show":"Show 379","Description":"Jim and Greg kick off the Sound Opinions World Tour with a musical voyage to Sweden. DJ Stefan Wermelin is our guide through Swedish Pop history from ABBA to Robyn.","Guests":"Stefan Wermelin","ShowNotes":"1 For as long as we can recall, the music industry story has been a sad one. But perhaps, there\u2019s a happy ending? It has taken 13 years, but music revenues are finally up, albeit by 3%. But that\u2019s still cause for celebration. Looks like digital music has been a big boost to the record biz, with its contribution to 30% of sales. And who was selling? Well, no surprises here: Adele and Carly Rae Jepsen are the reigning queens.\n\n2 This week the Center for Copyright Information, which includes members of the RIAA, MPA and many ISP\u2019s, will begin to alert users engaged in illegal activity like piracy. The system hopes to be educational, rather than punitive. So, after \u201csix strikes,\u201d or alerts, a user may lose internet speed or be forced to watch videos about piracy. Will this be enough to curb a commonplace practice? We dunno, but here\u2019s a video to tell you more. And please note the exits to your right and left.\n\n3 Jim and Greg have always insisted that rock \u2018n\u2019 roll belongs to the world. In our new series, the Sound Opinions World Tour, they prove it by zeroing in on countries that\u2019ve made big contributions to global rock and pop. Their first stop is the largest exporter of music per capita in the world: Sweden. Swedish DJ and public radio host Stefan Wermelin is our guide through the country\u2019s musical history. Stefan explains that in the \u201850s and \u201860s, Sweden was a pop music backwater. Musicians churned out cut-rate covers of American and English hits. The \u201860s hippie \u201cProgg\u201d movement injected some originality and artistic ambition into Swedish music, but things didn\u2019t really change until ABBA hit it big with \u201cWaterloo.\u201d According to Stefan, ABBA set the template for Swedish success. The band created big hits by co-opting the best bits of global pop music and stitching them together with meticulous production. That tradition of pastiche continues today with Swedish producers like Max Martin, the man behind a hundred-and-one Billboard Top Ten hits (Britney Spears\u2019 \u201c\u2026Baby One More Time\u201d and Kelly Clarkson\u2019s \u201cSince U Been Gone\u201d among them). But today, Sweden\u2019s also experiencing an indie renaissance in genres as varied as death metal, dance music, and Americana. Decades after ABBA, artists like The Knife,Lykke Li, Robyn, Opeth, and First Aid Kit are staging a second Swedish invasion.\n\nCheck out our Sweden Playlist, inspired by this week\u2019s show, on Spotify.\n\n4 After his solo project The Eraser, Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke went out on tour with a group that could only be described as \u201csuper\u201d: Red Hot Chili Peppers\u2019 Flea on bass, Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich on programming, Joey Waronker on drums and Mauro Refosco on percussion. The collaboration worked so well that the group has released an album under the name Atoms for Peace. Greg was impressed with how The Eraser really found its identity live, and he has high hopes AMOK will do the same. But on record, the songs are not as strong as the production, so he can only say Burn It. In terms of his unique voice, Thom Yorke has finally won Jim over. He gets the robotic and alien nature of the voice the electronic musicianship and the dystopian lyrics and says Buy It.\n\n5 Miles Davis has been on Greg\u2019s mind lately, and his revolutionary string of early \u201870s albums(including Bitches Brew, Live-Evil, and On the Corner) have been fixtures on Greg\u2019s turntable for weeks. Miles\u2019 rock and funk explorations can be partially credited to (or blamed on, depending on your point of view) his then wife, Betty Davis. She put out her own series of great records after their divorce. For his Desert Island Jukebox pick this week, Greg turns to the first song on Betty Davis\u2019 1973 self-titled debut, \u201cIf I\u2019m in Luck I Might Get Picked Up.\u201d Betty put together an incredible band of Santana and Sly Stone sidemen (including Larry Graham on bass!), and wrote parts for them that contained more than enough grit and grime to complement her raspy blues roar and bawdy lyrics. Even Prince personally told Greg that he uses this song as a frequent source of inspiration!

Plus, guitar great Richard Thompson goes \"Electric.\"","Guests":"Jimmy Cliff","ShowNotes":"1 Another Grammy night has come and gone, and again it was all about the performances. The award show had its second biggest ratings night since 1993, and one of the biggest newsmakers was someone who wasn\u2019t even eligible for an award: Justin Timberlake. Other big winners were Mumford & Sons and Frank Ocean. Jim and Greg talk about some of the Grammy\u2019s bizarre voting and eligibility rules and compare these winners to those who took home the prize for Village Voice Pazz & Jop Poll.\n\n2 And speaking of Grammys, singer-songwriter Jimmy Cliff walked away with his second \u201cBest Reggae Album\u201d Grammy last week. Rebirth is Cliff\u2019s 30th reggae record in a career that spans the history of the genre. Talking to Jim and Greg, he traces the evolution of reggae from party music celebrating Jamaican independence, to a more introspective music about roots, spirituality, and identity. While he may not be as famous as countryman Bob Marley, Cliff was instrumental in breaking reggae in the U.S. As the starring actor and songwriter for the cult film The Harder They Come, he introduced Americans to Rastafarian culture, dancehall music, and his own hits \u201cYou Can Get It If You Really Want\u201d and \u201cThe Harder They Come.\u201d Cliff might be a reggae founding father, but he\u2019s no purist. He talks approvingly of punk\u2019s adoption of reggae sounds and even returns the compliment: Rebirth features a cover of The Clash\u2019s \u201cGuns of Brixton,\u201d a song originally inspired by The Harder They Come.\n\n3 To put it simply: our hosts think Richard Thompson is the most revered guitarist working today. And the fact that he\u2019s been doing it and doing it well for over 4 decades is nothing short of a miracle. So yes, that means his latest album, Electric, is a Buy It. Need we say more? (We didn\u2019t think so, but just in case, here\u2019s more from Jim and more from Greg.)\n\n4 It\u2019s always sad to hear of a musician passing, but Jim admits that no death has hit him harder in recent years than that of Reg Presley. The Troggs lead singer was no great talent and no great looker, but he was full of attitude. And The Troggs have an entire catalog of great songs\u2026.not just \u201cWild Thing.\u201d So in his honor, Jim adds \u201cI Can\u2019t Control Myself\u201d to the Desert Island Jukebox this week.

The group\u2019s string of \u201870s albums for Westbound and Mercury Records, driven by Bonner\u2019s lead vocals and electrifying double-neck guitar work, stands as one of the most impressive runs in funk history. Their distinct sound found new life in the in the late \u201880s and \u201890s as countless hip hop artists sampled the group\u2019s work (a Red Hot Chili Peppers cover of \u201cLove Rollercoaster\u201d on the soundtrack for Beavis and Butthead Do America didn\u2019t hurt either). Greg highlights \u201cSkin Tight\u201d as prime example of Bonner\u2019s musical legacy.\n\n 2 This week the dB\u2019s, one of power pop\u2019s great underexposed bands, stops by the Sound Opinions studio for an interview and a brief live set. The group came together in 1978 as part of New York City\u2019s punk and new wave scene, and put out two classic, but minimally distributed albums before singer\/guitarist Chris Stamey left the group. Two more low profile records followed before the group broke up in 1988. Now the original dB\u2019s lineup is back with a new album, Falling Off the Sky. Jim used to frequently go see this band live in their earliest days, and it\u2019s clear that they haven\u2019t lost a step in their few decades off. During their visit, the band rips through three songs from Falling Off the Sky, and Stamey and co-frontman Peter Holsapple talk with Jim and Greg about their early days in North Carolina, their label woes in the \u201880s, and their decision to reunite not for a paycheck, but just because they were itching to play again. After you hear their interview, check out these two bonus performances: \u201cHappenstance\u201d and \u201cNeverland,\u201d both from their second album Repurcussion.\n\n3 Beyonce has been making a lot of news, with her lip-syncing and Superbowling, but we\u2019re more interested in kid sis Solange. She has a new extended EP out called True, and both Jim and Greg say it\u2019s a perfect, mini release. She sounds nothing like Beyonce and has been embracing alt-R&B and indie rock\u2014exactly what you expect from someone who dragged her brother-in-law to a Grizzly Bear show. Greg is excited to hear her expand her sound even more on a full length album. And Jim compares True to the Scorcese flick After Hours. Solange gets a double Buy It.\n\n4 Greg\u2019s been in a Joni Mitchell phase, and is particularly smitten with the singer\/songwriter\u2019s 1976 release For the Roses. Between her folk phase and her avant-jazz phase, she released this record with the track \u201cYou Turn Me On, I\u2019m a Radio.\u201d Is it directed towards a romantic figure? Or a record company one? Add that question to the layers of sounds and influences from country to Latin to jazz, and you\u2019ve got one wonderfully complicated song.","PullQuote":"","Recurringsegments":"Greg's DIJ","AlbumReviews":"Solange - True EP","FeaturedSongs":"Ohio Players, \u201cLove Rollercoaster,\u201d Honey, Mercury, 1975\nOhio Players, \u201cSkin Tight,\u201d Skin Tight, Mercury, 1974\nThe dB\u2019s, \u201cWonder of Love,\u201d Falling Off the Sky, Bar None Records, 2012\nChris Bell, \u201cI Am the Cosmos,\u201d I Am the Cosmos, Rykodisc, 1992\nThe dB\u2019s, \u201cThat Time is Gone,\u201d (Live on Sound Opinions), Falling Off the Sky, Bar None Records, 2012\nThe dB\u2019s, \u201cBlack and White,\u201d Stands for Decibels, Albion Records, 1981\nThe dB\u2019s, \u201cThe Fight,\u201d Stands for Decibels, Albion Records, 1981\nThe dB\u2019s, \u201cThe Adventures of Albatross and Doggerel,\u201d (Live on Sound Opinions), Falling Off the Sky, Bar None Records, 2012\nThe dB\u2019s, \u201cWorld to Cry,\u201d (Live on Sound Opinions), Falling Off the Sky, Bar None Records, 2012\nThe dB\u2019s, \u201cDynamite,\u201d Stands for Decibels, Albion Records, 1981\nSolange Knowles, \u201cLosing You,\u201d True EP, Terrible Records, 2012\nSolange Knowles, \u201cLocked in Closets,\u201d True EP, Terrible Records, 2012\nJoni Mitchell, \u201cYou Turn Me on I\u2019m a Radio,\u201d For the Roses, Asylum, 1972\nThe Knife, \u201cFull of Fire,\u201d Shaking the Habitual, Rabid\/Brille\/Mute, 2013\nViolent Femmes, \u201cTelephone Book,\u201d 3, Slash, 1989\nTrey Parker, \u201cUp There,\u201d South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, Atlantic, 1999\nYo La Tengo, \u201cOhm,\u201d Fade, Matador, 2013\nThe Mothers of Invention, \u201cWho Needs the Peace Corps?,\u201d We\u2019re Only in it for the Money, Verve, 1968\nBlondie, \u201cRapture,\u201d Autoamerican, Chrysalis, 1980","Audio":"http:\/\/audio.soundopinions.org\/streams\/2013\/02\/so_20130201.m3u","MainImage":"http:\/\/www.soundopinions.org\/images\/2013\/thedbs.jpg","FlickrPhotoSet":"","Videos":""},{"Date":"1.25.2013","Show":"Show 374","Description":"Trey Parker and Matt Stone - the creative minds behind South Park and The Book of Mormon - discuss the intersection between music and comedy.","Guests":"Trey Parker & Matt Stone","ShowNotes":"1 Justin Timberlake played a social-media mogul in the movies, but can he do it in real-life? The JT-backed social media site MySpace recently re-launched with a sleeker design and 50 million-plus song library. The company says it\u2019s the internet\u2019s largest legally streamable song library. Or is it? A group representing indie labels like Merge, Domino, and Beggar\u2019s Group is alleging that MySpace has its members\u2019 music up without permission. Will MySpace be able to work out a deal? Given the site\u2019s 27 million unique visitors a month, Greg\u2019s betting the indie labels will find a way to compromise.\n\n2 Jim always suspected rock \u2018n\u2019 roll was a hazardous occupation. Now experts at Britain\u2019s Health Department have weighed in, and guess what? It\u2019s true. A study of 1,500 artists across genres concludes that 9.2 percent of rockers die earlier than regular folks. Not only that, but solo artists face twice the death-risk of artists in bands. Researchers speculated that bands provide an extra support network for at-risk stars. Turns out we really do get by with a little help from our friends.\n\n3 It\u2019s time to \u201cMan Up\u201d for a visit from Trey Parker and Matt Stone. They are the dynamic duo behind South Park and the hit Broadway musical The Book of Mormon. \u201cWhat are they doing on our rock and roll show?\u201d you ask. Well, some of the greatest moments of satire (see last week\u2019s show)  on South Park are musical. In fact, check out our favorites here.\n\nPlus, you could argue the show itself is quite punk rock with it\u2019s no holds barred attitude and lo-fi animation. The show even spawned a Rick Rubin-produced album. Now we have an equally outrageous musical, The Book of Mormon. It tells the story of two Mormon missionaries sent to a remote village in northern Uganda. It\u2019s even \u201cbluer\u201d than South Park, but despite this, or\n perhaps because of it, it\u2019s a smash hit. Trey, Matt and collaborator Robert Lopez have won a slew of Tony Awards and a record-breaking slot on the Billboard chart. So, how\u2019d two Ween, Primus and Prog Rock fans from Colorado end up the toast of Broadway? Trey and Matt explained this and their songwriting philosophy during their visit to our studios. They were in town for the Chicago opening of the play.\n\n4 At the beginning of the New Order review, Greg calls the English band\u2019s latest album Lost Sirens almost a collection of \u201cleftovers.\u201d That can\u2019t bode too well for it. New Order\u2019s music in the 1980\u2019s was undeniably influential. There\u2019d be no LCD Soundsystem or Radiohead without their electronic pop innovations. But, Jim doesn\u2019t hear anything that evokes their Madchester greatness on this effort. He says Trash It. Greg really liked the tracks \u201cI Told You So\u201d and \u201cHellbent\u201d, so that bumps up his rating to a Burn It.\n\n5 Who knew Denton, TX was a rock capital? There\u2019s Midlake and Neon Indian. Sly Stone was born there! And now we have Parquet Courts. With their 2nd release Light Up Gold, the garage quartet has relocated to Brooklyn and is getting much wider attention. The album is a perfect combination of expert pop craftsmanship and slacker-punk attitude. Jim and Greg grinned through this review, so Parquet Courts gets a double Buy It.","PullQuote":"","Recurringsegments":"","AlbumReviews":"New Order - Lost Sirens\nParquet Courts - Light Up Gold","FeaturedSongs":"Justin Timberlake (feat.

While a law is in place to extend copyrights in the E.U. from 50 to 70 years, that won\u2019t go into effect until 2014. That means that as of New Year\u2019s Eve 2012, early tracks like \u201cLove Me Do\u201d are up for grabs. Early tracks by Bob Dylan, however, have recently been protected. In order to avoid its catalog going into public domain, Sony Music has taken advantage of the law\u2019s \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d clause. They released a compilation aptly titled, The 50th Anniversary Collection: The Copyright Extension Collection, Vol. 1. It\u2019s only available in certain European countries though, so American Dylan fans will have to be willing to pay big bucks on eBay.\n\n2 This is typically the dry season for major album releases, but there have been a lot of buzzworthy singles. Jim and Greg run through some of the big ones. They never thought they\u2019d utter the words \u201cnew David Bowie track,\u201d but we\u2019ve got one called \u201cWhere Are We Now,\u201d with a Tony Visconti-produced album to follow. Then there\u2019s JT\u2019s new chart-topper \u201cSuit and Tie.\u201d A couple of weeks ago Jim and Greg made a plea for the gentleman of Outkast to come back together, and now we have both Big Boi and Andre 3000 appearing on a remix of Frank Ocean\u2019s \u201cPink Matter.\u201d But, Andre is quick to squash any reunion rumors. Last, but not least, are the ladies of Destiny\u2019s Child. There\u2019s a new song called \"Nuclear\u201d and plans for the three to appear together during the Superbowl Halftime Show. Guess motherhood has made Beyonce nostalgic.\n\n3 Next week, South Park and Book of Mormon creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone join Jim and Greg in the studio to talk music and comedy. The duo\u2019s trademark musical satire has won them tons of fans - and a few Tony awards. In advance of the boys\u2019 visit, Jim and Greg warm up the crowd with a mix of rock n\u2019 roll\u2019s Best Satirical Songs.

Over 13 albums, Jim says, Yo La\u2019s established itself as a band of impeccable taste.

Sales increased by 3% in 2012, driven mostly by digital music. And, what was long suspected has now been confirmed: Adele has topped the charts two years in a row, making her the first artist in the SoundScan era to do this. 2012\u2019s other big winners? Taylor Swift, One Direction, Bieber, and the only act in this year\u2019s top 10 to come close to \u201crock\u201d \u2013 Mumford & Sons. At least Jim and Greg can take solace in the fact that vinyl sales were up yet again. \n\n2 This week Jim and Greg are joined by Aimee Mann. On her latest release Charmer, we get a series of character sketches all about charmers\u2014from the charismatic to the completely narcissistic. As a veteran of the music biz, it\u2019s a topic about which we\u2019re sure Aimee knows a thing or three. But, she insists that the album isn\u2019t just an L.A. story. She does, \nhowever, pull in some impressive celebrities for the vidoes. Check out Jon Hamm and Jon Wurster in the Tom Scharpling-directed \u201cLabrador,\u201d  which is a shot-by-shot remake of Aimee\u2019s classic hit \u201cVoices Carry.\u201d Then there\u2019s Laura Linney in the title track. Amy talks with Jim and Greg about spoofing herself, her affinity for comedians and her feelings about piracy. She also performs songs from the new album, as well as her Oscar-nominated tune \u201cSave Me.\u201d\n\n2b For more Mann-madness, we\u2019ve posted our Top Aimee Man moments here.\n\n3 Two years ago, Bruno Mars won Jim over with his infectious (and ubiquitous) \u201cLazy Song.\u201d Like its author, \u201cThe Lazy Song\u201d was youthful and hard to dislike. Plus, who cab resist Bruno\u2019s \nbackstory? The pop phenom got his start at age four impersonating Elvis in his hometown of Honolulu before founding top-tier production team The Smeezingtons. Having crafted hits for the likes of Cee Lo and Travis McCoy, Bruno released a solo debut, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, in 2011. Late last year we got the follow up, Unorthodox Jukebox. Jim and Greg kick off their review by playing \u201cGorilla\u201d. It\u2019s \u201cthe stupidest song on the album\u201d according to Greg, though there are some other contenders. Bruno\u2019s randy lyrics are nothing to write home about, but even on this record's stinkiest tracks, there are redeeming pop touches \u2013 a cool chord progression or a spot-on Prince falsetto. Jim agrees. Bruno Mars may be a lightweight, but his re-workings of Elton John, disco, and Sam Cooke are appealing and melodic. This is appropriation, but it\u2019s good appropriation.

Jim explains that we first narrow \ndown a list of albums that are either interesting or making news. Then it comes down to what would make a good mix for the show. So if the feature segment is all about soul, we might like to get a little punk at the end. Greg answers part two, and explains that he tries to listen to an album as many times as possible and, most importantly, in as many different scenarios as possible. He hears music very differently whether he is driving down Lake Shore Drive in Chicago or doing dishes at home.\n\n1b This leads to question #2. Nathan in Chicago is looking for suggestions on how to heighten the digital music experience. Can we do better than just headphones in an ipod? Jim and Greg admit they are not always seeking the most hi-fi experience, so they turn to Bob Gendron, copy editor for Music Direct and contributor to the Chicago Tribune. Bob recommends Nathan get a pair of Grado SR-60i headphones. Priced at $79, they give nice bang for the buck. But if Nathan is a high roller who wants his mind blown, Bob refers him to the Audeze LCD-3.\n\n1c Chris from Corvallis, OR emailed interact@soundopinions.org for recommendations on songs to learn to play on ukulele.

As Jim and Greg explain, the artists of this movement were students of rock history. They looked at the guitar as something more than a traditional blues instrument. Those hunks of wire and wood could act as a sound machine. You can trace a line from bands like The Velvet Underground and Dinosaur Jr. to key Shoegaze bands like My Bloody Valentine, Lush, Ride and Slowdive. And their desire to marry rock drive with otherworldly ambience is what carries the genre into the present moment. It\u2019s also important to note that while the term \u201cshoegazer\u201d began as derisive\u2014musicians staring at their shoes are no fun to watch\u2014seeing these acts live was really a special, albeit loud, experience.\n\n3 We may not have heard new Outkast since 2006's Idlewild, but one-half of that groundbreaking Atlanta hip hop duo has a new record out. Big Boi\u2019s first solo album, Sir Lucious Leftfoot\u2026The Son of Chico Dusty, came out in 2010 to positive reviews. Now he's followed it up with Vicious Lies & Dangerous Rumours. How does the new record stack up? Well Jim calls it \"hip-hop at its best.\" Big Boi's been playing the rock festival circuit and he's nothing if not ambitious with his collaborations on Vicious Lies. Everyone from indie band Wavves to more traditional hip-hop guest Kid Cudi makes an appearance on this record. For Jim, the songs succeed or fail on the strength of the guest, which makes this only a Burn It album. Greg agrees. Big Boi's solo records mostly remind him of how much he misses Outkast. Can't those two guys get back together already? Vicious Lies & Dangerous Rumours gets a Burn It.","PullQuote":"","Recurringsegments":"","AlbumReviews":"Big Boi - Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors","FeaturedSongs":"Lynyrd Skynyrd, \u201cDon\u2019t Ask Me No Questions,\u201d Second Helping, MCA, 1974\nThe Smiths, \u201cAsk,\u201d single, Rough Trade, 1986\nPaul McCartney, \u201cSomewhere,\u201d unreleased live performance, 2008\nMy Bloody Valentine, \u201cOnly Shallow,\u201d Loveless, Creation, 1991\nThe Velvet Underground, \u201cSister Ray,\u201d White Light\/White Heat, Verve, 1968\nThe Byrds, \u201cEight Miles High,\u201d Fifth Dimension, Columbia, 1966\nCocteau Twins, \u201cLorelei,\u201d Treasure, 4AD, 1984\nMy Bloody Valentine, \u201cTo Here Knows When,\u201d Loveless, Creation, 1991\nMy Bloody Valentine, \u201cI Only Said,\u201d Loveless, Creation, 1991\nMy Bloody Valentine, \u201cBlown a Wish,\u201d Loveless, Creation, 1991\nLush, \u201cThoughtforms,\u201d Mad Love EP, 4AD, 1990\nLush, \u201cLovelife,\u201d Split, 4AD, 1994\nRide, \u201cDreams Burn Down,\u201d Nowhere, Creation, 1990\nRide, \u201cI Don\u2019t Know Where It Comes From,\u201d Carnival of Light, Creation, 1994\nSlowdive, \u201cSing,\u201d Souvlaki, Creation, 1993\nSlowdive, \u201cRichard,\u201d Hide Your Eyes, bootleg, 2011\nSlowdive, \u201cShine,\u201d single, Creation, 1991\nThe Besnard Lakes, \u201cAlbatross,\u201d The Besnard Lakes Are the Roaring Night, Jagjaguwar, 2010\nBig Boi, \u201cMama Told Me (feat.

Plus they review the new album from \"Girl on Fire\" Alicia Keys.","Guests":"","ShowNotes":"1 This week Jim and Greg ponder the history of the Supergroup. This is the rock phenomenon where musicians from different bands blend together to form a new group. Take one 1 guitar virtuoso, sprinkle in a legendary drummer and add a dash of star singing\u2014sometimes this is a great success, and sometimes the ingredients just don\u2019t mix. Recently there have been a number of new supergroups such as The Good, the Bad and the Queen, Them Crooked Vultures, Tinted Windows, Dead Weather and Monsters of Folk. For Jim the keys to a\n winning supergroup are that the members be individually \u201csuper,\u201d and that they have chemistry together. Greg adds that there needs to be more compelling the super-union than just business.\n                                                                \nHere are some hits and misses throughout history:\n\nTraveling Wilburys\nChickenfoot\nMillion Dollar Quartet\nCream\nBlind Faith\nCrosby, Stills, Nash (and Young)\nUK\nGolden Palomino\nElectronic\nTemple of the Dog\nAudioslave\nLucy Pearl\n\n2 Since sweeping the Grammys in 2002 with her debut album, Songs in A Minor, some things have changed for piano pop star Alicia Keys. She's married to producer Swizz Beatz and has a young son named Egypt. Alicia might be a \"Brand New Me,\" but on her fifth studio album, Girl on Fire, she's out to convince us that she's still \u201cred hot.\u201d Does she succeed? Unfortunately, Greg says there's no spark here. While there's no questions Keys has chops, and she's heavily involved in the songwriting, album number five still doesn't let us in on who this pop diva really is. He adds that Alicia reminds him of a talented pro-athlete who, when faced with an interviewer, spouts mindless clich\u00e9s. Jim agrees\u2014there\u2019s no soul here. Girl on Fire is a piece of pop product circa 2012, and it gets a double Trash It.","PullQuote":"","Recurringsegments":"","AlbumReviews":"Alicia Keys - Girl on Fire","FeaturedSongs":"Traveling Wilburys, \u201cHandle With Care,\u201d Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1, Wilbury\/Warner Bros.

But don\u2019t tell that to the Rolling Stones. The veteran rockers are celebrating their 50 years in the business by releasing an app. As Mick explains, the Stones wanted to something \u201cspecial and innovative.\u201d And of course, they wanna sell stuff. Also coming around to this new fangled digital world is AC\/DC. The longstanding Apple holdouts will finally make their catalog available on iTunes. That just leaves a short list of withholders including Black Sabbath and Garth Brooks.\n\n2 Rihanna hit #1 this week for the first time. Jim and Greg review the new album later in the show, but are interested in the fact that Ri-Ri joined a long list of prominent artists in an open letter to Congress opposing the Internet Radio Fairness Act. Apparently, she doesn\u2019t credit streaming services like Pandora with her success. Members of Maroon 5, Pink Floyd and Katy Perry join Rihanna in saying, we dig you Pandora, but don\u2019t gut our royalties. Check out Greg\u2019s coverage of the debate from the recent Future of Music Summit.\n\n3 Well they are \u201csuper\u201d and they are a \u201cgroup,\u201d but don\u2019t let the categorization make you think any less of the new duo Divine Fits. It combines the talents of Britt Daniel of Spoon Dan Boeckner of Handsome Furs and Wolf Parade, and Sam Brown of New Bomb Turks, along with keyboardist Alex Fischel. Britt and \u201cserial-collaborator\u201d Dan (both veterans of the Sound Opinions studio) share the singing and songwriting duties, and the musical relationship began with just a simple phone call\u2026not an email! The result is the aptly named A Thing Called Divine Fits. Dan credits Sister Nancy as inspiration for the title. Check out video of their live performance.\n\n4 Reigning pop\/R&B queen and hook-singer du jour Rihanna is back with a new release called Unapologetic \u2013 her first to top the Billboard albums chart. The 24-year-old Barbadian singer has been all over the news in recent weeks, though not necessarily for her music. By dueting with the man who assaulted her in 2009 (fellow R&B singer Chris Brown on \u201cNobody\u2019s Business,\u201d\n Rihanna ensured her seventh studio album would be everybody\u2019s business. So how\u2019s the music? Jim calls the upbeat dance-pop fare on the first half of the record \u201cpure pop pleasure.\u201d But when things get sappier and slowed-down on side two, her limits as a vocalist become clear. Greg agrees with Jim that Rihanna\u2019s Chris Brown collab is pure \u201cbutton-pushing.\u201d He points to her 2009 album Rated R as a more ambitious and successful exploration of that troubled relationship. While he appreciates that the singer is moving in a more serious direction, he laments that the pop hooks just aren\u2019t there. Unapologetic gets a double Burn it.\n\n5 Jim\u2019s DIJ pick was inspired by an article he read recently in The New Yorker. In spite of a life-long hatred of The Grateful Dead, Jim made it through (and even enjoyed!) Nick Paumgarten\u2019s 25,000 words on the world of Deadhead bootleg tape collecting. No, this critic wasn\u2019t converted to the church of Jerry Garcia, but the article did remind him of some particular nasty punk songs with lyrics about the Dead. His favorite, \u201cPop Songs\u201d by Suicidal Tendencies, is this week\u2019s addition to the jukebox.","PullQuote":"","Recurringsegments":"Jim's DIJ","AlbumReviews":"Rihanna - Unapologetic","FeaturedSongs":"Lily Allen, \u201cNot Fair,\u201d It\u2019s Not Me, It\u2019s You, Regal, 2009\nThe Rolling Stones, \u201c(I Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction,\u201d Out of Our Heads, Decca, 1965\nDivine Fits, \u201cFlaggin\u2019 a Ride,\u201d A Thing Called Divine Fits, Merge, 2012\nDivine Fits, \u201cWhat Gets You Alone,\u201d A Thing Called Divine Fits, Merge, 2012\nSister Nancy, \u201cBam Bam,\u201d One, Two, Techniques Records, 1982\nDivine Fits, \u201cWould That Not Be Nice,\u201d (Live on Sound Opinions), A Thing Called Divine Fits, Merge, 2012\nDivine Fits, \u201cThe Salton Sea,\u201d A Thing Called Divine Fits, Merge, 2012\nDivine Fits, \u201cFor Your Heart,\u201d A Thing Called Divine Fits, Merge, 2012\nDivine Fits, \u201cMy Love is Real,\u201d (Live on Sound Opinions), A Thing Called Divine Fits, Merge, 2012\nDivine Fits, \u201cCivilian Stripes,\u201d (Live on Sound Opinions), A Thing Called Divine Fits, Merge, 2012\nDivine Fits, \u201cShivers,\u201d (Live on Sound Opinions), A Thing Called Divine Fits, Merge, 2012\nDivine Fits, \u201cBaby Get Worse,\u201d A Thing Called Divine Fits, Merge, 2012\nRihanna, \u201cDiamonds,\u201d Unapologetic, Def Jam, 2012\nRihanna, \u201cNobody\u2019s Business (feat.

Plus they review King Animal, the new record from grunge godfathers Soundgarden.","Guests":"Jody Stephens","ShowNotes":"1 With Black Friday kicking off the official holiday shopping season, Jim and Greg offer gift recommendations for the music lover in your life:\n\n1a Jim\u2019s been known to rail against Capitol records\u2019 flagrant re-issuing and re-re-issuing of the Beatles catalogue. But even he\u2019s been seduced by the label\u2019s new Beatles Stereo Vinyl Box Set. If your giftee is more of a Pink Floyd type, consider the band\u2019s Reflections and Echoes DVD box set, chock full of rare interview footage. \n\n1b\n\nGreg goes literary with his first pick. In a year that saw big rock biographies from Neil Young and Pete Townshend, he recommends David Bryne\u2019s under-the-radar How Music Works - a book that\u2019s part memoir, part meditation on the musician\u2019s craft. As for music, he recommends the new Bill Withers box set, The Complete Sussex and Columbia Albums.\n\n2\u00a0Jim and Greg celebrate the 40th anniversary of Big Star\u2018s debut album by revisiting their Classic Album Dissection of the band\u2019s first two records,\u00a0#1 Record\u00a0and\u00a0Radio City. #1 Record might be nearing middle age, but the pop sound Big Star pioneered in the seventies is as vibrant as ever. As Jim and Greg discuss, the band changed the history of American music, without\nselling very many records. With a sound that combined Memphis Soul with British Invasion rock, they laid the groundwork for American \u201cPower Pop\u201d and influenced bands including R.E.M., Wilco and The Replacements. The original Big Star lineup included former Box Tops singer\u00a0Alex Chilton,\u00a0Chris Bell,\u00a0Andy Hummel\u00a0and Jim and Greg\u2019s guest this week, drummer\u00a0Jody Stephens.\n\n3\u00a0Following their discussion with Jody Stephens, Jim and Greg each discuss and play a song. Greg chooses to highlight the opening track from #1 Record called \u201cFeel.\u201d The song was written and performed by\u00a0Chris Bell. While Alex Chilton is the name most people associate with Big Star, Bell really created it. Most of his incredible work didn\u2019t see the light of day until after his death at age 26, but Greg thinks songs like \u201cFeel,\u201d illustrate the power of his voice and lyrics\u2014many of which convey the problems he faced in his short life.\n\n3b\u00a0Jim plays a song written and performed by Alex Chilton from the second album called \u201cSeptember Gurls.\u201d As he discussed with Jody earlier in the show, this was a breakout song for the band and one that was immediately adored by critics and fans including\u00a0The Bangles, who later covered it. Jim\u2019s not sure what the song means, but for him it\u2019s more about the mood that Chilton created. With its sweeping melodies and \u201cpan-sexuality\u201d it\u2019s a power pop classic.\n\n4\n\n\u201cBeen Away Too Long\u201d is the first single off Soundgarden\u2019s new album, King Animal. As Jim points out, it\u2019s an understatement. The grunge godfathers have been away for 16 years, ever since conflict between the group\u2019s two big egos \u2013 lead singer Chris Cornell and guitarist Kim Thayil \u2013 tanked the band. Jim and Greg haven\u2019t looked kindly upon Chris Cornell\u2019s solo\ncareer. Has this former turkey redeemed himself on Soundgarden\u2019s latest? Jim and Greg say no. Greg was heartened by the album\u2019s first three tracks, but he says King Animal quickly devolved into a Chris Cornell solo album with backing band. As far as Jim is concerned, Soundgarden can stay away. He was never a fan and has no use for this record. Soundgarden gets a double Trash it.\n\n5 For his turn at the\u00a0Desert Island Jukebox, Greg wants to add a song by one of his favorite \u201cPower Pop\u201d bands. The term was actually coined by Pete Townshend during The Who\u2019s pre-rock opera era. It now describes a slew of bands that use big melodies, tight arrangements, harmonies and prominent guitar riffs. The Midwest produced a lot of power pop bands, including Green. The band has had many incarnations, but it\u2019s the constant force of Jeff Lescher that gives the group its edge and puts them above the rest for Greg. He takes their song, \u201cShe\u2019s Not a Little Girl\u201d with him to the deserted island.\n\n\n\n\n\n","PullQuote":"","Recurringsegments":"Classic Album Dissection:\nBig Star's \"#1 Record\" & \"Radio City\"","AlbumReviews":"Soundgarden - King Animal","FeaturedSongs":"Isley Brothers, \u201cSpecial Gift,\u201d The Soul Train Christmas Starfest Album, Epic, 1997 (0:22)\nThe Beatles, \u201cI am the Walrus,\u201d Magical Mystery Tour, Capitol\/Parlophone, 1967 (0:07)\nPink Floyd, \u201cHey You,\u201d The Wall, Harvest\/EMI, 1979 \nTalking Heads, \u201cPsycho Killer,\u201d Talking Heads: 77, Sire, 1977\nBill Withers, \u201cLean on Me,\u201d Live at Carnegie Hall, Sussex, 1973 (0:13)\nBig Star, \u201cIn the Street,\u201d #1 Record, Ardent, 1972 (0:36)\nBig Star, \u201cMy Life is Right,\u201d #1 Record, Ardent, 1972 (0:31)\nBig Star, \u201cWatch the Sunrise,\u201d #1 Record, Ardent, 1972 (0:38)\nBig Star, \u201cThe Ballad of El Goodo,\u201d #1 Record, Ardent, 1972 (0:25)\nBig Star, \u201cThe India Song,\u201d #1 Record, Ardent, 1972 (0:37)\nBig Star, \u201cThe India Song (Alternate Version),\u201d Keep an Eye on the Sky, Rhino, 2009 (1:23)\nBig Star, \u201cWhen My Baby\u2019s Beside Me,\u201d #1 Record, Ardent, 1972 (0:20)\nBig Star, \u201cBack of a Car,\u201d Radio City, Ardent, 1974 (0:17)\nBig Star, \u201cSeptember Gurls,\u201d Radio City, Ardent, 1974 (0:26)\nBig Star, \u201cO My Soul,\u201d Radio City, Ardent, 1974 (0:48)\nBig Star, \u201cST 100\/6,\u201d #1 Record, Ardent, 1972 (0:20)\nBig Star, \u201cFeel,\u201d #1 Record, Ardent, 1972 (2:04)\nBig Star, \u201cSeptember Gurls,\u201d Radio City, Ardent, 1974 (2:21)\nThe Replacements, \u201cAlex Chilton,\u201d Pleased to Meet Me, Sire, 1987 (1:12)\nSoundgarden, \u201cBeen Away Too Long,\u201d King Animal, Seven Four\/Republic, 2012 (0:29)\nSoundgarden, \u201cRowing,\u201d King Animal, Seven Four\/Republic, 2012 (1:31)\nGreen, \u201cShe\u2019s Not a Little Girl Anymore,\u201d Green, Ganggreen Records, 1986 (2:16)\nThe Beatles, \u201cAny Time at All,\u201d A Hard Day\u2019s Night, Parlophone, 1964 (0:13)\nKendrick Lamar, \u201cMoney Trees,\u201d good kid, m.A.A.d. city, Aftermath, 2012 (0:13)\nSoundgarden, \u201cBlack Hole Sun,\u201d Superunknown, A&M, 1994 (0:18)\nFiona Apple, \u201cHot Knife,\u201d The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You\nMore Than Ropes Will Ever Do, Epic, 2012 (0:12)\nGreen Day, \u201cNightlife,\u201d \u00a1Dos!, Reprise, 2012 (0:17)\n\n\n\n\n\n","Audio":"http:\/\/audio.soundopinions.org\/streams\/2012\/11\/so_20121123.m3u","MainImage":"http:\/\/www.soundopinions.org\/images\/2009\/bigstar.jpg","FlickrPhotoSet":"","Videos":""},{"Date":"11.16.2012","Show":"Show 364","Description":"Jim and Greg take down the worst musical turkeys of the year in our annual Turkey Shoot.

Unlike server farms, researchers point out, tape at rest consumes zero energy. Need more proof the cassette\u2019s not dead? Greg suggests taking a gander at the rare Radiohead cassette currently up on eBay for 50 grand.\n\n2 Well it\u2019s official: \u201890s nostalgia has arrived. CBS just announced the development of new sitcom, Smells Like Teen Spirit. The show follows a young entrepreneur as he tries to launch an internet startup with help from his \u201c1990\u2019s indie rock parents.\u201d Which got us thinking \u2013 what other alt-era hits could be re-purposed as TV pilots?

This band has been making consistently good agit-rap records since 1991, Greg says, but they remain best known for an unfortunate incident involving their cover art. Does the band deliver on Sorry to Bother You? Jim says yes. He wouldn\u2019t blame you for mistaking \u201cThe Magic Clap\u201d for a new OutKast party anthem. The Coup has verged dangerously close to Rage Against the Machine self-righteousness in the past, he says, but on Sorry to Bother You, the band\u2019s got the \u201cparty to politics\u201d ratio just right. Greg agrees and calls it the best Coup album yet. Sorry to Bother You gets a double Buy it.\n\n5 Soul singer Cody Chesnutt has a new album out, reminding Greg that he\u2019s often left off the list of masterful vocalists. This is clearly evident on his 2002 album The Headphone Masterpiece. In fact, The Roots were such fans they re-worked his song \u201cThe Seed\u201d into \u201cThe Seed (2.0).\u201d and released it as part of their album Phrenology.

But how she arrived at this top slot is curious, especially considering music industry trends. Her record label Big Machine kept the album off streaming services during its first week. That might\u2019ve forced fans out to the retail outlets. However, it contradicts the success Mumford and Sons was able to achieve with the heavily-streamed Babel. There\u2019s just no making sense of rock and roll.\n\n2 The votes have been tallied and the results are in! No, not those results. The Mercury Prize, of course. Britain\u2019s prestigious music prize has been awarded to the \u201cBoffin Rock\u201d band Alt-J. These young lads beat out Django Django, Richard Hawley and Field Music, among others. What will they do with their \u00a320,000? Dinner with Mum and Dad, of course.\n\n3 When John Cale first visited Sound Opinions in 2005 as part of our debut on public radio, he shocked us all by name-dropping \u201cSnoop Dogg,\u201d \u201cThe Neptunes\u201d and the \u201cMPC.\u201d These influences have come to fruition on the Welshman\u2019s latest recording Shifty Adventures in Nookie Wood. And Jim and Greg were excited to have him come by the studios to perform the new \nmaterial. Plus, there\u2019s no lack of things to talk about with Cale, considering his decades-long career that includes founding The Velvet Underground and producing music by the likes of Patti Smith and The Stooges. After you hear the interview, check out this bonus track.\n\n4 The Psychedelic era might\u2019ve predated the boys in\u00a0Tame Impala\u00a0by about half a century, but it\u2019s\u00a0the\u00a0major musical influence on this Australian band. The brainchild of Perth\u2019s Kevin Parker, Tame Impala was discovered on MySpace. The band\u2019s debut,\u00a0Innerspeaker, was mixed by longtime Flaming Lips producer\u00a0Dave Fridmann. Fridmann was also on board for the band\u2019s latest,\u00a0Lonerism. As its name suggests,\u00a0Lonerism\u00a0is about someone who doesn\u2019t fit in. But Greg says Parker cannily avoids solipsism by cloaking his melancholy songs in uplifting (and obsessively detailed) pop production. It\u2019s a\u00a0Buy It\u00a0record for him. Jim\u00a0agrees. Tame Impala delivers psychedelic transcendence while remaining Britney Spears-catchy. Lonerism gets an enthusiastic\u00a0double Buy It.\n\n5 It was movie night recently in Jim\u2019s \u201cCritiquing the Arts\u201d class at Columbia College. He and his students sat down to watch Almost Famous \u2013 still the only feature film he knows about rock criticism. The film\u2019s opening number \u201cThe Oogum Boogum Song\u201d blew his students away, so this week Jim pays homage to this hidden gem with his Desert Island Jukebox pick. \u201cThe Oogum Boogum Song\u201d is the work of R&B singer\u00a0Brenton Wood, a Compton native and fan of Sam Cooke who narrowly avoided being a one hit wonder with his other hit, \u201cGimme Little Sign.\u201d Jim puts \u201cThe Oogum Boogum Song\u201d alongside other nonsense rock classics like \u201cMMMBop\u201d and \u201cTutti Frutti.\u201d","PullQuote":"","Recurringsegments":"Jim's DIJ","AlbumReviews":"Tame Impala - Lonerism","FeaturedSongs":"Taylor Swift, \u201cBegin Again,\u201d Red, Big Machine, 2012\nAlt-J, \u201cSomething Good,\u201d An Awesome Wave, Infectious Music, 2012\nJohn Cale, \u201cNookie Wood,\u201d Shifty Adventures in Nookie Wood, Double Six, 2012\nJohn Cale, \u201cLeaving it Up to You,\u201d Helen of Troy, Island, 1975\nJohn Cale, \u201cCatastrofuk,\u201d (Live on Sound Opinions), Extra Playful EP, Domino\/Double Six, 2011\nJohn Cale, \u201cMary,\u201d Shifty Adventures in Nookie Wood, Double Six, 2012\nJohn Cale, \u201cI Wanna Talk 2 U,\u201d Shifty Adventures in Nookie Wood, Double Six, 2012\nJohn Cale, \u201cFace to the Sky,\u201d (Live on Sound Opinions), Shifty Adventures in Nookie Wood, Double Six, 2012\nPatti Smith, \u201cLand,\u201d Horses, Arista, 1975\nThe Stooges, \u201cNo Fun,\u201d The Stooges, Elektra, 1965 (0:34)\nJohn Cale, \u201cDecember Rains,\u201d (Live on Sound Opinions), Shifty Adventures in Nookie Wood, Double Six, 2012\nJohn Cale, \u201cVampire Cafe,\u201d Shifty Adventures in Nookie Wood, Double Six, 2012\nTame Impala, \u201cElephant,\u201d Lonerism, Modular Recordings, 2012\nTame Impala, \u201cBe Above It,\u201d Lonerism, Modular Recordings, 2012\nBrenton Wood, \u201cThe Oogum Boogum Song,\u201d Oogum Boogum, Double Shot, 1967\nTame Impala, \u201cEndors Toi,\u201d Lonerism, Modular Recordings, 2012\nThe Black Angels, \u201cTelephone,\u201d Phosphene Dream, Blue Horizon, 2010\nThe Turtles, \u201cThe Grim Reaper of Love,\u201d single, White Whale, 1966\nThe Scotland Yard Gospel Choir, \u201cAspidistra,\u201d The Scotland Yard Gospel Choir, Bloodshot Records, 2007\nJames Brown, \u201cNight Train,\u201d Live at the Apollo, Polydor, 1963\nThe \u201c5\u201d Royales, \u201cThink,\u201d single, King, 1957","Audio":"http:\/\/audio.soundopinions.org\/streams\/2012\/11\/so_20121109.m3u","MainImage":"http:\/\/www.soundopinions.org\/images\/2012\/johncale.jpg","FlickrPhotoSet":"","Videos":""},{"Date":"11.02.2012","Show":"Show 362","Description":"Fifty years after it was recorded, Jim and Greg give James Brown's Live at the Apollo a Classic Album Dissection.","Guests":"R.J. Smith","ShowNotes":"1 Singer-songwriter Terry Callier never got the acclaim he deserved in the early part of his life, but as Greg explains, his influence was strong. The Chicago native released a Chess Records debut in 1968, and went on to fuse folk with jazz and experimental music. It\u2019s a sound that caught the attention of younger artists like Beth Orton and Devendra Banhart. And you can best hear it on the 1973 track \u201cYou\u2019re Goin Miss Your Candyman.\u201d \n\n2 Before he was America\u2019s Godfather of Soul, James Brown was the king of the South\u2019s segregated chitlin\u2019 circuit. It took Live at the Apollo \u2013 an album recorded fifty years ago last month on Brown\u2019s own dime\u2013 to catapult him onto the national stage. In honor of its fiftieth, Jim and Greg give Brown\u2019s Live at the Apollo a well-deserved Classic Album Dissection with help from music writer RJ Smith. RJ\u2019s biography of Brown, The One: The Life and Music of James Brown, came out earlier this year. As RJ explains, James Brown was all about the live experience. He knew if radio listeners could just hear his live show, he could be \u201cGary Cooper big.\u201d He was right. High-energy numbers like \u201cNight Train\u201d and \u201cThink\u201d propelled Brown onto the pop charts and super-charged his career. But as Greg notes, Live at the Apollo wasn\u2019t just a turning point for Brown personally, it was a turning point for music. Suddenly doo-wop and soul was starting to sound\u2026funky.\n\n3 It\u2019s been a busy 2012 for Neil Young. Not only has he given us a memoir, Waging Heavy Piece, he\u2019s also given us two albums. This spring we got the antique folk romp Americana. Now we have Psychedelic Pill \u2013 an epic three records\u2019 worth of psychedelic guitar from Neil and the band he was born to play with, Crazy Horse.  How good a prescription is Psychedelic Pill? Greg\u2019s the first to admit there\u2019s a lot of flab on this record. But standout tracks like \u201cRamada Inn\u201d (about an affair gone sour) and \u201cWalk Like a Giant\u201d (in which Neil reflects on the hippie dream) make this record a worthwhile, if lengthy, listen. Greg says Burn It. As much as it pains him, Neil\u2019s #1 fan Jim DeRogatis has to disagree. Never has he heard worse lyrics or more self-indulgent guitar from Neil. This record is sprawling in a bad way. Jim says Trash It.\n\n4 At 25, Kendrick Lamar is shouldering some pretty heavy expectations for his major label debut, Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City. The Compton rapper caught the attention of Dr. Dre and rap tastemakers with his independent debut Section.80. Does Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City live up to all the hype? Jim acknowledges Kendrick\u2019s skill as a lyricist \u2013 he says his rhymes are almost novelistic \u2013 and he understands he is taking on characters in his songs. However he\u2019s troubled by the gangsta clich\u00e9s. No amount of self-awareness, Jim says, makes it ok to indulge in 50 Cent-style misogyny. Jim gives Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City a Trash It rating. Greg couldn\u2019t disagree more. He thinks Lamar has yet to meet the rap clich\u00e9 he couldn\u2019t upend. Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City is wrestling with Compton\u2019s legacy in a way that eludes sound bites and lyrics-quoting. Greg says it\u2019s a Buy It record that requires close listening.","PullQuote":"","Recurringsegments":"Classic Album Dissection - James Brown's \"Live at the Apollo\"","AlbumReviews":"Neil Young & Crazy Horse - Psychedelic Pill\nKendrick Lamar - good kid, m.A.A.d. city","FeaturedSongs":"Terry Callier, \u201c900 Miles,\u201d The New Folk Sound of Terry Callier, Prestige, 1968\nTerry Callier, \u201cYou Goin\u2019 Miss Your Candyman,\u201d What Color is Love, Cadet, 1972\nJames Brown & The Famous Flames, \u201cI\u2019ll Go Crazy,\u201d Live at the Apollo, Polydor, 1963\nThe Swanee Quintet, \u201cTake the Lord with You,\u201d Take the Lord with You, MCA, 1998\nLittle Richard, \u201cTutti Frutti,\u201d Here\u2019s Little Richard, Specialty Records, 1957\nJames Brown & The Famous Flames, \u201cI Don\u2019t Mind,\u201d Live at the Apollo, Polydor, 1963\nJames Brown & The Famous Flames, \u201cTry Me,\u201d Live at the Apollo, Polydor, 1963\nJames Brown & The Famous Flames, \u201cMedley: Please, Please, Please\/You\u2019ve Got The Power\/I Found Someone\/Why Do You Do Me\/I Want You \nSo Bad\/I Love You, Yes I Do\/Strange Things Happen\/Bewildered\/Please, Please, Please,\u201d Live at the Apollo, Polydor, 1963\nJames Brown & The Famous Flames, \u201cI Don\u2019t Mind,\u201d Live at the Apollo, Polydor, 1963\nJames Brown & The Famous Flames, \u201cLost Someone,\u201d Live at the Apollo, Polydor, 1963\nJames Brown & The Famous Flames, \u201cNight Train,\u201d Live at the Apollo, Polydor, 1963\nJames Brown & The Famous Flames, \u201cIntroduction to James Brown and The Famous Flames,\u201d Live at the Apollo, Polydor, 1963\nJames Brown & The Famous Flames, \u201cMedley: Please, Please, Please\/You\u2019ve Got The Power\/I Found Someone\/Why Do You Do Me\/I Want You \nSo Bad\/I Love You, Yes I Do\/Strange Things Happen\/Bewildered\/Please, Please, Please,\u201d Live at the Apollo, Polydor, 1963\nJames Brown & The Famous Flames, \u201cNight Train,\u201d Live at the Apollo, Polydor, 1963\nJames Brown & The Famous Flames, \u201cThink,\u201d Live at the Apollo, Polydor, 1963\nJames Brown & The Famous Flames, \u201cNight Train,\u201d Live at the Apollo, Polydor, 1963\nNeil Young & Crazy Horse, \u201cDriftin\u2019 Back,\u201d Psychedelic Pill, Reprise, 2012\nNeil Young & Crazy Horse, \u201cWalk Like a Giant,\u201d Psychedelic Pill, Reprise, 2012\nKendrick Lamar, \u201cSwimming Pools (Drank),\u201d good kid, m.A.A.d. city, Aftermath, 2012\nKendrick Lamar, \u201cgood kid,\u201d good kid, m.A.A.d. city, Aftermath, 2012\nTonikom, \u201cHope,\u201d Found and Lost, Hymen Records, 2012\nDe La Soul, \u201cRing Ring Ring (Ha Ha Hey),\u201d De La Soul is Dead, Tommy Boy, 1991\nVanilla Fudge, \u201cSeason of the Witch,\u201d Renaissance, Atco Records, 1968\nFrank Zappa, \u201cZomby Woof,\u201d Over-Nite Sensation, Disc-Reet, 1973\nHelium, \u201cWanna Be a Vampire Too, Baby,\u201d Pirate Prude EP, Matador, 1994\nBlue Oyster Cult, \u201cGodzilla,\u201d Spectres, Columbia, 1977","Audio":"http:\/\/audio.soundopinions.org\/streams\/2012\/11\/so_20121102.m3u","MainImage":"http:\/\/www.soundopinions.org\/images\/2012\/jamesbrown.jpg","FlickrPhotoSet":"","Videos":""},{"Date":"10.26.2012","Show":"Show 361","Description":"Jim and Greg comb their record collections for the best tracks about Monsters for this year\u2019s Sound Opinions Halloween Special.\n\n                                                                        ","Guests":"","ShowNotes":"1a Every Halloween Jim and Greg like to celebrate with music.

This time, Jim reports, they\u2019re bringing out the\u00a0big guns, introducing their new music and entertainment service under the industry-leading\u00a0Xbox brand. That\u2019s right kids \u2013 Xbox isn\u2019t just for gaming anymore. If Microsoft has its way, it\u2019ll soon be your center for music streaming, buying, and sharing. Is it too late for Microsoft to regain its mojo and compete with Apple, Spotify, and Pandora? Jim says only time will tell, but Microsoft\u2019s certainly ceded a lot of ground since its world dominance in the nineties.\n\n2 After notorious border checkpoint\u00a0Sierra Blanca busted yet another music industry star this week, Greg takes it upon himself to issue a PSA to all tour bus drivers: if you know what\u2019s good for you, clean out your bus! Since 2010 the checkpoint has caught\u00a0Willie Nelson,\u00a0Snoop Dogg, and\u00a0Fiona Apple in the act of transporting drugs (and the occasional gun) across the border. Now we have\u00a0Nelly, busted for an impressive 36 pounds of heroin, ten pounds of pot, and a loaded pistol. Guess he\u2019ll know better next time.\n\n3 Knowing Jim and Greg\u2019s affection for pop melodies smothered in noise, it should come as no surprise that\u00a0Ty Segall\u2019s music hits them right in the sweet spot. The 24-year-old musician was born in Orange County California, but made his name in San Francisco\u2019s thriving\u00a0garage rock\u00a0revival scene. Ty is nothing if not prolific. Since 2008 he\u2019s released eight albums, including three this year:\u00a0Hair\u00a0in April,\u00a0Slaughterhouse\u00a0in June, and now\u00a0Twins\u00a0in October. Shortly after\u00a0Slaughterhouse\u2019s release Ty and his band joined Jim and Greg onstage at Lincoln Hall in Chicago for a live taping of Sound Opinions. He talked about the MTV\u00a0reality show that ruined his hometown, his early punk influences, and his love of old garage rock. And of course, he and the band performed a raucous live set (we\u2019ve only just regained our hearing).\n\n4 Kaleidoscope Dream, the new album by Miguel debuted at #3 on the Billboard chart. But he\u2019s still an unfamiliar name to most people. The R&B singer and songwriter had moderate success with his first record and has penned songs for Mary J. Blige and Usher. And with this sophomore effort, he really goes all out. You can hear influences from all over the map \u2013 from Marvin Gaye to The Zombies. But it\u2019s his unique spin and musical chops that make Jim and Greg give the album an enthusiastic double Buy It.\n\n5 Jim was a fan of Grizzly Bear back when the band appeared on Sound Opinions in 2009. But something was missing from their album Veckatimist. Who knew that \u201csomething\u201d was a little Coldplay? The harder rocking stomp and grandeur on Shields fits perfectly with their beautiful harmonies and baroque-pop craftsmanship, according to Jim. He says Buy It. Greg loves Grizzly Bear\u2019s take on chamber pop, and especially the drumming on Shields. But he\u2019s missing a sense of immediacy on the songs. So Greg goes with a Burn It.\n\n                                                                ","PullQuote":"","Recurringsegments":"","AlbumReviews":"Miguel - Kaleidoscope Dream\nGrizzly Bear - Shields","FeaturedSongs":"Aaliyah, \u201cTry Again,\u201d Romeo Must Die: The Album, Blackground, 2000\nRay Charles, \u201cBusted,\u201d Ingredients in a Recipe for Soul, ABC, 1963\nTy Segall, \u201cWould You Be My Love,\u201d Twins, Drag City, 2012\nLe Shok, \u201cShe Prefers Whips,\u201d Hey Brother Volume 4, Vegas Records, 1998\nThe Mermen, \u201cOcean Beach,\u201d Krill Slippin\u2019, Beach Recordings, 1995\nTy Segall Band, \u201cDiddy Wah Diddy,\u201d Slaughterhouse, Drag City, 2012\nThe 13th Floor Elevators, \u201cYou\u2019re Gonna Miss Me,\u201d The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators, International Artists, 1966\nTy Segall Band, \u201cDeath,\u201d (Live on Sound Opinions), Slaughterhouse, Drag City, 2012\nTy Segall, \u201cYou\u2019re the Doctor,\u201d Twins, Drag City, 2012\nTy Segall, \u201cThank God for Sinners,\u201d Twins, Drag City, 2012\nTy Segall & White Fence, \u201cThe Tongue,\u201d Hair, Drag City, 2012\nTy Segall, \u201cGoodbye Bread,\u201d Goodbye Bread, Drag City, 2011\nTy Segall, \u201cFinger,\u201d (Live on Sound Opinions), Melted, Drag City, 2010\nTy Segall, \u201cLove Fuzz,\u201d Twins, Drag City, 2012\nThe Troggs, \u201cI Want You,\u201d Wild Thing, Fontana, 1966\nTy Segall Band, \u201cWave Goodbye,\u201d (Live on Sound Opinions), Slaughterhouse, Drag City, 2012\nTy Segall, \u201cWho Are You,\u201d Twins, Drag City, 2012\nMiguel, \u201cAdorn,\u201d Kaleidoscope Dream, RCA, 2012\nMiguel, \u201cSure Thing,\u201d All I Want is You, Jive, 2010\nMiguel, \u201cKaleidoscope Dream,\u201d Kaleidoscope Dream, RCA, 2012\nMiguel, \u201cDon\u2019t Look Back,\u201d Kaleidoscope Dream, RCA, 2012\nGrizzly Bear, \u201cYet Again,\u201d Shields, Warp, 2012\nGrizzly Bear, \u201cA Simple Answer,\u201d Shields, Warp, 2012\nAraabMuzik, \u201cAfter Hours,\u201d Electronic Dream 2, self released, 2012\nGrateful Dead, \u201cOperator,\u201d American Beauty, Warner Bros., 1970\nThe Doobie Brothers, \u201cThe Doctor,\u201d Cycles, Capitol, 1989\nYoung Marble Giants, \u201cConstantly Changing,\u201d Colossal Youth, Rough Trade, 1980\nMumford & Sons, \u201cLover of the Light,\u201d Babel, Island, 2012","Audio":"http:\/\/audio.soundopinions.org\/streams\/2012\/10\/so_20121019.m3u","MainImage":"http:\/\/www.soundopinions.org\/images\/2012\/tysegall.jpg","FlickrPhotoSet":"","Videos":""},{"Date":"10.12.2012","Show":"Show 359","Description":"Passion Pit frontman Michael Angelakos joins Jim and Greg in the studio for a frank conversation and live performance.","Guests":"Michael Angelakos","ShowNotes":"1 Foes of digital music have often cited streaming services like Pandora as the reason for the demise of the middle-of-the-road musician. Sure, artists like Drake and Coldplay can succeed, but what about everyone else? Well, Tim Westergren, Pandora's founder has revealed some surprising sales numbers that put this idea to rest. He says Pandora pays over 2,000 artists more than $10,000 a year, and over 800 artists make $50,000. Of course, it's only the Adeles of the world that can rake in $1 million, but that still bodes pretty well for many working musicians.\n\n2 This week, Passion Pit frontman Michael Angelakos is in the studio with Jim and Greg for a frank conversation and stripped-back live set. As Michael tells Jim and Greg, the band began with a belated Valentine\u2019s Day present. Angelakos \u2013 then a student at Boston\u2019s Emerson College - posted a track he\u2019d written for his girlfriend to MySpace. \u201cSleepyhead\u201d quickly exploded on the net. Passion Pit have since released two critically acclaimed albums and toured the world. Their latest release, Gossamer combines upbeat dance tracks and high production values with lyrics that explore Angelakos\u2019s own experience with addiction and mental illness. (As Michael tells Jim and Greg, the band had to cancel dates this year so that he could deal with issues related to his manic depression). The contrast between upbeat music and dark lyrics, Michael explains, is what he\u2019s always found interesting in pop music, and it\u2019s the key to the Passion Pit project. Despite Gossamer\u2019s harrowing content, Michael says the album is ultimately hopeful \u2013 an effort to achieve transcendence amid tough circumstances.\n\n3 Wanda Jackson, Queen of Rockabilly since 1954, is out with a new album. Unfinished Business \u2013 like last year\u2019s The Party Ain\u2019t Over \u2013 is produced by a young fan. This time, Jim explains, it\u2019s Justin Townes Earle, not Jack White, at the helm. Neither Jim nor Greg was a fan of the Caribbean-flavored, White-produced The Party Ain\u2019t Over. Does Earle fare better? Greg says yes. You have to remember, he says, that in addition to being rockabilly royalty, Jackson has a background in country and gospel. She sounds perfectly at home covering artists like Freddy King and Etta James. Greg gives Unfinished Business a Buy It.\n Jim agrees that Earle played it smart by keeping Wanda in her comfort zone and allowing her feistiness to shine through. But he says there are three or four other Jackson albums he\u2019d recommend over this one. He gives Unfinished Business a Burn It.\n\n4 As the presidential election approaches, Greg\u2019s thoughts turn to the terrific L.A. band X. He picks \u201cThe New World,\u201d the leadoff track on the band\u2019s 1983 album, More Fun in the New World, for this week\u2019s DIJ. For Greg, this song perfectly reflects the meaning (or lack thereof) of a presidential election for society\u2019s have-nots. In the song, X takes the perspective of a politically apathetic homeless person. Whoever wins the election, he explains, nothing really changes for those at the bottom of the economic latter. But the song\u2019s narrator doesn\u2019t totally lose hope. In the chorus he urges the politicians of the day: \u201cDon\u2019t forget the motor city!\"\n","PullQuote":"","Recurringsegments":"DIJ - Greg\n\nAs the presidential election approaches, Greg\u2019s thoughts turn to the terrific L.A. band X.

They prescribe a musical remedy for a rock fan in need: this time it's acclaimed graphic novelist & comic book writer Mark Crilley in the waiting room.","Guests":"","ShowNotes":"1 It\u2019s been a busy week for the pop charts. For 45 years, Elvis dominated the Billboard Top 100 with 108 career hits. This week Lil\u2019 Wayne beat The King\u2019s record with his 109th hit \u2013 a cameo in The Game\u2019s \u201cCelebration.\u201d And with 600,000 in first week sales British folkies Mumford & Sons had the biggest opening of 2012 with Babel. They also beat Spotify\u2019s streaming record, with 8 million listens in its first week. So much for the theory that streaming cannibalizes sales.\n\n2 After upsetting fans at New York\u2019s Global Citizen Festival with the announcement that the band had no upcoming shows, Dave Grohl has finally put those Foo Fighter breakup fears to rest (or not?). In a letter on the band\u2019s website, Grohl says the band is simply on hiatus. Jim says he wouldn\u2019t mind if the hiatus were permanent.\n\n3a Those of you lucky enough to be able to work to music know that finding a perfect soundtrack isn't always easy. There's the matter of tempo, lyrics and beats. And for acclaimed comic book creator, children's book writer\/illustrator and graphic novelist Mark Crilley, the challenge is \"vibe.\" His latest series for Dark Horse is Brody's Ghost. It follows a serial killer hunter, and the material is much darker than his Akiko and Miki Falls series. Dark art calls for dark tunes, but Mark is a self-proclaimed musical \"softie.\" So he contacted the Rock Doctors to get a prescription for albums that are edgy, but still full of pop hooks and melody.\n\n3b Dr. Kot prescribed Stridulum II by Zola Jesus. The Wisconsin native combines an operatic voice and Gothic keyboards to create musical psychodramas. After taking his medicine for a week, Mark decides that a couple of the tracks will make his playlist, but for the most part this album was too dark. Dr. DeRogatis prescribed The Haunted Man by Bat for Lashes. This is Natasha Khan's third release, and Mark fell in love with moody lyrics and surprisingproduction. The Haunted Man worked like a miracle pill, and he'll be going back for this one while working on the 4th installment of Brody's Ghost. Look for it next spring.\n\n4 Mumford & Sons\u2019 sophomore album Babel has done gangbusters on the album charts, but how will it fare on Sound Opinions\u2019 Buy It, Burn It, Trash It scale? Mumford & Co. emerged from London\u2019s thriving folk-rock scene in 2009 with a breakout album Sigh No More that landed them a slot performing with Bob Dylan at the Grammys. With their vests, beards, banjo, and dobro, the band sticks out in the mainstream rock scene, but as Greg explains, the difference is only skin deep. The boys\u2019 folky instruments and wardrobe are just signifiers of folk. At its base Mumford & Sons are a sadly conventional arena rock band. Jim could not agree more. The band\u2019s lyrics are vague and bland\u2014the complete opposite of the biblical stories that they claim as inspiration. Babel gets a double Trash It.\n\n5 Next up is rapper Lupe Fiasco\u2019s Food & Liquor II: The Great American Rap Album . It wasn\u2019t too long ago in 2006 that Jim and Greg reviewed Lupe\u2019s debut, the original Food & Liquor.\n It was a standout album in a wave of conscious hip-hop coming out of Chicago at the time. Now at age 30, Lupe is a veteran of the rap game. What does he have to offer on Food & Liquor II? According to Jim, plenty of food for thought. Lupe is rapping about issues like misogyny, economic exploitation of the poor, and native American rights that Jim says no one else in hip-hop is tackling. And if Lupe sometimes gets a little preachy, he also leavens his critiques with humor. Greg agrees, but he wishes the greatness of Lupe\u2019s lyrics were matched by consistently great production. Despite those production flaws, Food & Liquor II gets a double Buy It.\n\n6 After Mumford & Sons, Jim was sorely in need of a folk-rock palette cleanser. So for his DIJ he chose one of the great folk rock musicians of all time, Richard Thompson. A founder of Fairport Convention, Thompson went on to make music with his wife, Linda Thompson, and as a solo artist. Like Marcus Mumford, Thompson has a yen for the biblical. But unlike Mumford, he used Bible stories to spine-tingling affect. Case in point, \u201cThe Calvary Cross,\u201d a track he recorded with Linda on their 1974 album I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight. Listen for the drums echoing Jesus\u2019s footsteps as he climbs the hill where he will be crucified.","PullQuote":"","Recurringsegments":"Rock Doctors\nDIJ - Jim\n\nAfter Mumford & Sons, Jim was sorely in need of a folk-rock palette cleanser.

The big four major labels are now \ndown to three. So what could go wrong with one company controlling more than forty percent of the music market? According to Greg, a lot. Take a streaming service like Spotify: for Spotify to launch, the company had to obtain licensing deals for its music from the majors. With so much of the world\u2019s music now in UMG\u2019s hands, Greg predicts it\u2019s going to be a lot tougher for tomorrow\u2019s Spotifys and Pandoras to get into business. He sums it up: big tech and big labels 1, the little guy, 0.\n\n2 Are you one of the three remaining people on earth who haven\u2019t seen Psy\u2019s \u201cGangnam Style\u201d video? Better get hip fast. The South Korean rapper just broke the Guinness Book of World Records\u2019 entry for most YouTube likes (2.2 million). Back in June Sound Opinions prophesied that K-pop \u2013 Korean pop music \u2013 was poised to make a big splash in the States. But even Jim admits he never thought the genre\u2019s breakout star would be a rotund rapper singing about a posh Seoul neighborhood.\n\n3 This summer three hundred fans joined Jim and Greg for a sold-out live taping of Sound Opinions at Chicago\u2019s Lincoln Hall. The night\u2019s special guests? Canadian garage rock duo Japandroids. Drummer David Prowse and guitarist Brian King were in a feisty mood, taking Jim to task for his characterization of their music as \u201cwonderfully ugly.\u201d \u201cIs that a back-handed compliment?\u201d Brian wanted to know. The two also performed tracks from their sophomore album, Celebration Rock (a Buy It for both Jim and Greg). Dave and Brian met as students in Victoria, British Columbia. (If you\u2019re thinking of visiting, Brian recommends the Wax Museum\u2019s \u201cChamber of Horrors.\u201d) They launched Japandroids in 2006 and tried to make a go of it in the Vancouver music scene, already home to bands like Chet and Atlas Strategic. Despite the fact there\u2019s only two of them, Japandroids make quite a roar, and they quickly made a name for themselves as an exhilarating live act. But they found frustratingly few venues to play in Vancouver. By the time Japandroids released their debut, Post-Nothing, in 2009, Dave tells Greg they thought it would be their farewell. That didn\u2019t happen. Internet fate intervened, Post-Nothing blew up, and Brian and David embarked on a year and a half of touring. As its title suggests, Celebration Rock is really a party record. But Greg detects a note of melancholy amidst the boozing. Brian\u2019s response: \u201cIf this is the last record we\u2019re ever going to do, let\u2019s make sure it\u2019s the best record we\u2019re ever going to do.\u201d\n\n4 As a band Green Day is so firmly rooted in the adolescent mindset, it\u2019s easy to forget how much history they have. As Jim points out, Green Day predates the nineties alternative era. They started out as an East Bay band riffing on the Ramones and playing VFW halls. Today they have a musical, American Idiot, and nine studio albums to their name. The ninth, \u00a1Uno! is just out. Billed as a \u201cback to basics\u201d record, Greg says \u00a1Uno! really samples from several of Green Day\u2019s eras - from the teenage sneer of Dookie, to the \u201cTime of Your Life\u201d balladry of Nimrod. What\u2019s missing on \u00a1Uno!, he says, is the ambition of the band\u2019s later records, American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown. For Greg, Green Day\u2019s harkening back to its teenage self (particularly in its foul language on this record) feels like a step backward. He gives \u00a1Uno! a Trash It. Jim agrees \u00a1Uno! is a big disappointment. The only thing that saves it from the garbage heap is the great Dookie-era production of Rob Cavallo. Jim gives \u00a1Uno! a Burn It.\n\n5 Jim and Greg close out this week\u2019s show with a review of the sophomore album by The xx. This trio of London art students enjoyed a rapid rise after the release of their self-titled debut. Not only did The xx win Britain\u2019s Mercury Prize for the best record of 2009, they performed on Sound Opinions! The hype for their follow-up has been intense. Coexist debuted at No. 1 in the UK and No. 5 in the U.S. Jim says if you liked the first record, chances are you\u2019ll like this one too. The band has talked in interviews about stripping back its already minimal sound, and Jim agrees. This is a spare, intimate bedroom recording.

The report confirms some common knowledge, but as Jim and Greg point out, it also contains a few surprises. We already knew the U.S. led the world in BitTorrent downloads, but who knew Drake was our most pirated artist? (Canadians seem to be returning the compliment - their most pirated artist is Kanye). The BBC\u2019s city-by-city breakdown  of the U.K.\u2019s most-pirated artists is even more intriguing. We should\u2019ve known teen pop juggernaut Justin Bieber would claim a few towns (Oxfordshire and Great Yarmouth) but who knew Isle of Wight residents loved Louis Armstrong so much?\n\n2 El-P, aka Jaime Meline, joins Jim and Greg in the Sound Opinions studio this week. Take a look at any of the underground hip-hop that came out of New York in late \u201890s, and chances are you\u2019ll find El-P somewhere in the background. As a rapper, producer, and head of the indie record label Definitive Jux, El-P has left an indelible mark on New York hip-hop. And he\u2019s not slowing up anytime soon. This year, El-P produced Killer Mike\u2019s R.A.P. Music and his own solo album, Cancer 4 Cure. El-P grew up in Brooklyn during hip-hop\u2019s golden age in the eighties. By 1993 he\u2019d founded his own group, Company Flow. He tells Jim and Greg how creating the track \u201cLast Good Sleep,\u201d for their sophomore album, Funcrusher Plus, transformed his approach to songwriting. The more specific and personal the story, El says, the more universal. Today, even El-P\u2019s \u201cpolitical\u201d songs are more about internal struggles than external ones. In fact the title for his record, Cancer 4 Cure, is inspired by the idea that our bodies are constantly fighting off an illness latent inside us. Not to suggest that Cancer 4 Cure is a downer. There\u2019s hope, Jaime says, \u2013 though \u201cnot unbattered hope\u201d \u2013 that the characters in his songs will come through.\n\n3 Jim and Greg wrap up the show with a review of Bob Dylan\u2019s 35th studio album Tempest. After fifty years of recordings, do they even have to introduce the inimitable Robert Zimmerman? Tempest is Bob\u2019s first album since 2009\u2019s widely panned Christmas in the Heart, and it continues the trend of him producing his own albums. So what do we get on Tempest? Dylan\u2019s voice, Greg notes, has always been unconventional, but fifty years has added considerable gravel and dirt to it. Nevertheless, it\u2019s the voice, Greg says, the really carries this album. It\u2019s perfect for the spur-of-the-moment, rough and rowdy honky-tonk feel Dylan is going for. Greg gives Tempest a Buy It. Jim agrees. Dylan has always been interested in pop culture figures \u2013 he\u2019s sung about everyone from Rubin \u201cHurricane\u201d Cater to Joe Gallo \u2013 so he wasn\u2019t too surprised to hear a Leonardo DiCaprio cameo on Tempest\u2019s title track. What can he say? Bob\u2019s still got a sense of humor. Tempest gets a double Buy It.\n\n                                                                ","PullQuote":"","Recurringsegments":"","AlbumReviews":"Bob Dylan - Tempest","FeaturedSongs":"Ed Sheeran, \"U.n.i.,\" Ed Sheeran, Atlantic, 2011\nCompany Flow, \"Last Good Sleep,\" Funcrusher Plus, Rawkus, 1997\nRun D.M.C., \"Sucker M.C.'s,\" Run D.M.C., Arista, 1984\nEl-P, \"$4 Vic,\" (Live on Sound Opinions) Cancer 4 Cure, Fat Possum, 2012\nEl-P, \"For My Upstairs Neighbor,\" Cancer 4 Cure, Fat Possum, 2012\nCompany Flow, \"Bee Aware,\" Little Johnny From the Hospital, Rawkus, 2002\nCannibal Ox, \"Iron Galaxy,\" The Cold Vein, Definitive Jux, 2001\nEl-P, \"The Nang, The Front, The Bush And The Shit,\"\nEl-P, \"The Jig Is Up,\" (Live on Sound Opinions) Cancer 4 Cure, Fat Possum, 2012\nEl-P, \"Request Denied,\" Cancer 4 Cure, Fat Possum, 2012\nKiller Mike, \u201cR.A.P.

Too often they\u2019re not the sum of their parts. But Off!\u2019s visit last week had them feeling hopeful about the debut record from yet another indie supergroup, Divine Fits. Divine Fits is composed of songwriters Britt Daniel of Spoon, Dan Boeckner of Wolf Parade (and Handsome Furs, and drummer Sam Brown of New Bomb Turks. The combination of Daniel and Boeckner, Greg notes, is an interesting and potentially troublesome one. Whereas Daniel is cool and reserved, Boeckner is intense and in your face. So does A Thing Called Divine Fits live up to its lofty pedigree? Greg says it does. Daniel and Boeckner might bring different personalities to this partnership, but the two are kindred spirits when it comes to production style. Both embrace a minimalist, stripped-back approach to recording that Greg says makes listeners hyper-aware of musical details like the occasional castanet or maraca. He gives A Thing Called Divine Fits a Buy It. Jim can\u2019t echo Greg\u2019s enthusiasm. He says Divine Fits fails by abandoning the most successful elements of its members\u2019 previous groups. Divine Fits has all the angularity of Spoon, for example, but none of its driving intensity. It has all Handsome Furs\u2019 electronic edifice, \nwithout any of the sensuality that made that group compelling. Jim gives A Thing Called Divine Fits a Trash It.\n\n3 For his DIJ, Greg wants to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Los Lobos\u2019s Kiko. In 1992, grunge acts like Nirvana were shaking up the mainstream, and veteran acts like Los Lobos had to either reinvent or face irrelevance. Kiko, Greg says, was Los Lobos\u2019s answer to grunge\u2019s challenge. The group started out in the seventies playing a fusion of American roots rock and Mexican folk. Kiko saw main songwriters David Hidalgo and Louie Perez moving in a more trippy psychedelic direction, writing lyrics that were so concise, they were almost haiku-like. The band\u2019s new sound only really began to gel however when their label put them in the studio with producers Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake. Froom and Blake pumped up the distortion and keyboard effects, and suddenly Los Lobos were walking into a new sonic world. Greg says the album\u2019s opening track, \u201cDream in Blue,\u201d represents the door opening onto that new world. Hidalgo and Perez\u2019s lyrics describe a sleeping child who, as she begins to dream, finds herself entering a realm of unprecedented freedom.","PullQuote":"","Recurringsegments":"Buried Treasures\nDIJ - Greg\n\nFor his DIJ, Greg wants to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Los Lobos\u2019s Kiko.

A lover of show tunes, he wrote nuanced, emotional lyrics in the sixties and seventies when rock n\u2019 roll was ascendant. By retrofitting the Tin Pan Alley aesthetic for the rock generation, he became one of the most charting songwriters of the second half of the 20th century. Ever sung along to \u201cWhat\u2019s New Pussycat?\u201d or \u201cRaindrops Keep Fallin\u2019 on My Head\u201d? You have David to thank.  David and Bacharach\u2019s most fruitful collaborationwas with Dionne Warwick. She started singing demos for them in the sixties. Frustrated that she never got to record their hits herself, she stormed out of the studio one day snapping \u201cDon\u2019t make me over!\u201d a line that inspired David and Bacharach\u2019s first hit song for her \u201cDon\u2019t Make Me Over\u201d in 1963.\n\n2 We at Sound Opinions thought it wise to send a noise alert to our colleagues the day OFF! visited the studio. This punk supergroup doesn\u2019t hold back, delivering minute long bursts of tightly structured punk anger. OFF! is the project of four veterans of the LA punk and hard rock scenes. They are Keith Morris of Black Flag and Circle Jerks fame, Dimitri Coats of Burning Brides, Steve McDonald, and Mario Rubalcaba of Rocket From the Crypt. Since getting together in 2009, the foursome has released two full-lengths: First Four EPs and this year\u2019s official debut, OFF! Their sound harkens back to the heyday of LA hardcore, the genre Morris helped develop in the late seventies with Black Flag. But the band firmly rejects the hardcore label. Steve explains how the term came to be associated with violence and the boneheaded, testosterone-addled teens \u201cwho were the reason I got into punk in the first place.\u201d So what does the band prefer to be called? \u201cWe\u2019re a rock n\u2019 roll band\u201d says Morris. \u201cJust crank it up.\u201d\n\n3 And now for something completely different. Indie darling Chan Marshall, who goes by the stage name Cat Power, has a new album out called Sun. Sun is not what one generally associates with Cat Power. Over eight solo albums Marshall has developed a dusky, lonesome sound whose pure melancholy is often intensified in concert (she\u2019s been known to curl up in a fetal ball onstage, so overcome with anxiety that she is unable to continue playing). Marshall wrote Sun as she was breaking up with her actor boyfriend Giovanni Ribisi, so one might ask, how sunny can Sun possibly be? Jim says it\u2019s all relative, but he likes this album better than Marshall\u2019s previous efforts. Instead of wallowing, Chan seems to be in self-help mode, reminding herself in \u201cRuin\u201d that some people \u201cdon\u2019t have s*** to eat.\u201d And Jim likes that she\u2019s traded in the dirgy guitar and piano for more upbeat synths on this record. He gives Sun a Burn It. Like Jim, Greg has found Marshall hard to take on previous albums, but he\u2019s come to appreciate Sun. Chan, he says, is in a dancier mood here \u2013 she\u2019s even got a fun little pop number in \u201c3,6,9\u201d \u2013 so he gives Sun a Buy it.\n\n4 Next Jim and Greg review the new solo album from an artist they affectionately call \u201cUncle Grumpy\u201d: Bob Mould. If you were a music-loving kid coming up in the alternative \u201880s, Jim says, Mould\u2019s band H\u00fcsker D\u00fc, was a revelation. The band imploded too early to cash in on the nineties alternative gravy train, so Mould founded another band, Sugar, in 1992. He also put out a prolific series of arty solo albums. Lately, Mould\u2019s moved away from music to pursue writing. He published an autobiography See a Little Light last year (and discussed it on Sound Opinions). He says writing about his life inspired him to make Silver Age, a record he\u2019s called dumb rock fun. Is that true? Jim says Uncle Grumpy\u2019s just putting the critics off the scent. Like Mould\u2019s book, this record is all about dark and light, highs and lows. It\u2019s also got a wicked sense of humor. \u201cStar Machine,\u201d he says, is one of the most vicious eviscerations of the corporate rock machine he\u2019s ever heard. Jim gives Silver Age a Buy It. Greg agrees. He says Mould can be a bit meticulous and fussy in his solo work, but here he\u2019s letting it fly. Plus, he\u2019s got Superchunk\u2019s Jon Wurster playing drums on his record. So how could it be bad?","PullQuote":"","Recurringsegments":"","AlbumReviews":"Cat Power - Sun\nBob Mould - See a Little Light\n","FeaturedSongs":"Isaac Hayes, \u201cWalk on By,\u201d Hot buttered Soul, Enterprise, 1969\nDionne Warwick, \u201cDon\u2019t Make Me Over,\u201d Presenting Dionne Warwick, Scepter, 1962\nOFF!, \u201cUpside Down,\u201d First Four EP\u2019s, Vice,  2010\nCircle Jerks, \u201cRed Tape,\u201d Group Sex, Frontier, 1980\nOFF!, \u201cBlack Thoughts,\u201d First Four EP\u2019s, Vice,  2010\nThe Clash, \u201cTommy Gun,\u201d Give \u2018Em Enough Rope, CBS, 1978\nOFF!, \u201cBorrow and Bomb (Live on Sound Opinions),\u201d OFF!, Vice, 2012\nBlack Flag, \u201cNervous Breakdown,\u201d Nervous Breakdown, SST, 1978\nOFF!, \u201cI Got News For You,\u201d OFF!, Vice, 2012\nOFF!, \u201cCompared to What,\u201d single, Vice, 2011\nOFF!, \u201cFeeling are Meant to be,\u201d OFF!, Vice, 2012\nOFF!, \u201cWrong,\u201d OFF!, Vice, 2012\nStiff Little Fingers, \u201cSuspect Device,\u201d Inflammable Material, Rought Trade, 1979\nOFF!, \u201cKing Kong Brigade (Live on Sound Opinons),\u201d OFF!, Vice, 2012\nD.O.A, \u201cD.O.A.\u201d Hardcore \u201981, Sudden Death, 1981\nAngel, \u201cTower,\u201d Angel, Casablanca\/Mercury, 1975\nThe Damned, \u201cBorn To Kill,\u201d Damned Damned Damned, Stiff, 1977\nBlack Flag, \u201cRise Above,\u201d Damaged, SST, 1981\nOFF!, \u201cElimination (Live on Sound Opinions),\u201d OFF!, Vice, 2012\nOFF!, \u201cWiped Out,\u201d OFF!, Vice, 2012\nOFF!, \u201cRotten Apple,\u201d single, Vice, 2011\nCat Power, \u201cCherokee,\u201d Sun, Matador, 2012\nCat Power, \u201cRuin,\u201d Sun, Matador, 2012\nBob Mould, \u201cSilver Age,\u201d Silver Age, Merge 2012\nBob Mould, \u201cStar Machine,\u201d Silver Age, Merge 2012\nAretha Franklin, \u201cCall ME,\u201d This Girl\u2019s In Love With You, Atlantic, 1970\nThe Ramones, \u201cLet\u2019s Dance,\u201d Ramones, Sire, 1976\nThe Adverts, \u201cOne Chord Wonders,\u201d Crossing the Red Sea with the Adverts, Bright, 1978\nSpanky and Our Gang, \u201cSunday Will Never Be the Same,\u201d Spanky and Our Gang, Mercury, 1967\nDave Edmunds, \u201cHere Comes the Weekend,\u201d Get It, Swan Song Records, 1977","Audio":"http:\/\/audio.soundopinions.org\/streams\/2012\/09\/so_20120907.m3u","MainImage":"http:\/\/www.soundopinions.org\/images\/2012\/off.jpg","FlickrPhotoSet":"","Videos":""},{"Date":"8.31.2012","Show":"Show 353","Description":"Jim and Greg revisit their conversation with The Apples in Stereo\u2019s Robert Schneider about the Elephant 6 Recording Collective.

To those who think rock music is just entertainment, he says, \u201cthink again.\u201d Greg points out that Pussy Riot aren\u2019t the first musical act to suffer serious consequences for politically charged music.

This week, Jim and Greg run down their favorites:\n\nJoe Jackson, \u201cSunday Papers\u201d\nT-Bone Walker, \u201cStormy Monday (But Tuesday is Just as Bad)\u201d\nThe Rolling Stones, \u201cRuby Tuesday\u201d\nCharles Mingus, \u201cWednesday Nigh Prayer Meeting\u201d\nMorphine, \u201cThursday\u201d\nCee Lo Green, \u201cBright Lights Bigger City\u201d\nElton John, \u201cSaturday Night\u2019s Alright for Fighting\u201d\nEtta James, \u201cA Sunday Kind of Love\u201d\n\n3 Jim and Greg review Fragrant World, the third album from Brooklyn band Yeasayer. Yeasayer started gaining buzz in the indie underground shortly after their 2007 debut, All Our Cymbals. Critics praised their inventive merging of shoegaze and world rhythms. Fans couldn\u2019t get enough of the hooks. Fragrant World promised to be something a little different: band members said they were inspired by Aaliyah\u2019s work with Missy Elliot. Fragrant World would be their take on R&B. Greg says the new album isn\u2019t as immediately hooky as past efforts, but when it comes to taking R&B to an alien landscape, Yeasayer succeeds big time. It took him a road trip with the record to be won over, but now he says it reminds him of Bowie\u2019s alien soul and funk in the seventies. Jim was a convert on first listen. The hooks are there, he says, but what really gets him is how the band downplays the novelty of their Eastern and African-tinged percussion, folding those drums seamlessly into electronic grooves. Fragrant World gets a double Buy It.","PullQuote":"","Recurringsegments":"","AlbumReviews":"Yeasayer - Fragrant World","FeaturedSongs":"Pussy Riot, \u201cPunk Prayer\u201c\nBikini Kill, \u201cRebel Girl,\u201d Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah, Kill Rock Stars, 1992\nFela Kuti, \u201cZombie\u201d, Zombie, Knitting Factory Records, 1977\nLeonard Cohen, \u201cEverybody Knows,\u201d I\u2019m Your Man, Columbia, 1988\nThe Easybeats, \u201cFriday On My Mind\u201d, Friday on My Mind (Single), United Artists, 1966\nJoe Jackson, \u201cSunday Papers,\u201d Look Sharp!, A&M, 1978\nT-Bone Walker, \u201cStormy Monday (But Tuesday is Just as Bad),\u201d Stormy Monday (But Tuesday is Just as Bad) (Single), Black & White, 1947\nFrank Sinatra, \u201cSunday, Monday or Always,\u201d Sunday, Monday or Always (Single), Columbia, 1943\nThe Beatles, \u201cEight Days A Week,\u201d Beatles for Sale, Parlophone, 1964\nThe Rolling Stones, \u201cRuby Tuesday,\u201d Between the Buttons, Decca, 1967\nCharles Mingus, \u201cWednesday Night Prayer Meeting,\u201d Me, Myself an Eye, Atlantic, 1979\nMorphine, \u201cThursday,\u201d Cure for Pain, Rykodisc, 1993\nCee Lo Green, \u201cBright Lights Bigger City,\u201d The Lady Killer, Elektra, 2010\nCure, \u201cFriday I\u2019m In Love\u201d, Wish, Elektra, 1992\nLoverboy, \u201cWorking For The Weekend,\u201d Get Lucky, Columbia, 1981\nElton John, \u201cSaturday Night\u2019s Alright For Fighting\u201d Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, MCA. 1973\nEtta James, \u201cA Sunday Kind of Love,\u201d At Last!, Argo, 1961\nYeasayer, \u201cFolk Hero Schtick,\u201d Fragrant World, Secretly Canadian, 2012\nYeasayer, \u201cHenrietta,\u201d Fragrant World, Secretly Canadian, 2012\nJim Croce, \u201cOperator,\u201d Don\u2019t Mess Around With Jim, ABC, 1972\nInsane Clown Posse, \u201cBoogie Woogie Wu\u201d, The Great Milenko, Island, 1997\nThe Stranglers, \u201cNo More Heroes, \u201c No More Heroes, United Artists, 1977\nThe Dead Kennedys, \u201cCalifornia Uber Alles,\u201d Fresh Fruit For Rotting Vegetables, Optional Music, 1979\nPassion Pit, \u201cI\u2019ll Be Alright\u201d Gossamer, Columbia, 2012","Audio":"http:\/\/audio.soundopinions.org\/streams\/2012\/08\/so_20120824.m3u","MainImage":"http:\/\/www.soundopinions.org\/images\/2012\/daysoftheweek.jpg","FlickrPhotoSet":"","Videos":""},{"Date":"8.17.2012","Show":"Show 351","Description":"In part two of our series 1977: The Year Punk Broke, Jim and Greg look at the punk movement stateside with music writer Ira Robbins. ","Guests":"","ShowNotes":"1a So you think you know how kids are consuming music these days? Think again. Media information company Nielsen just released a report that debunks many of the myths surrounding kids and music, the biggest of which is that they just don\u2019t buy it anymore. Teens, it turns out, consume more music than any other age group. And though YouTube has edged out radio as their primary means of discovering new music, over a third of teens bought an old-fashioned CD in the past year. What\u2019s most surprising? Only 17 percent of teens say they download music illegally.\n\n1b The Juggalos are fighting back! Last year the FBI placed the Juggalos \u2013 superfans of Detroit\u2019s horrorcore rap duo Insane Clown Posse \u2013 on its National Gang Threat Assessment list. At last weekend\u2019s gathering of the Juggalos, Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope announced they weren\u2019t taking the gang label (or accusations of petty theft and violence) lying down. They\u2019ve set up a website, juggalosfightback.com, where fans can submit complaints of discrimination based on their \u201cgang\u201d affiliation in preparation for what could be a class action lawsuit against the FBI. The incident reminds Jim of the FBI\u2019s similarly misguided \u201cinvestigation\u201d into the content of The Kingsmen\u2019s 1957 hit \u201cLouie Louie.\u201d He thinks maybe it\u2019s time the Feds turned off their radios and retired from cultural criticism.\n\n2 In the second and final installment of our series 1977: The Year Punk Broke, Jim and Greg explore the punk movement stateside with music writer Ira Robbins. Ira founded the music magazine Trouser Press in 1974. As a music journalist in New York, he was a fixture of the CBGBs scene, regularly \u201ctaking [his] life in his hands\u201d to go to second avenue and hear bands like the Ramones, the Dictators, the Dead Boys, and Television play divey clubs. Whereas punk enjoyed a rapid rise in the U.K. in 1977, Ira describes the New York scene as more of a slow simmer. Fans gradually migrated from clubs like Max\u2019s Kansas City, where glam acts like The New York Dolls ruled, to clubs like CBGBs where a younger, rawer set of performers was defining the punk look and sound. Though the Ramones, with their simple song structures and leather jackets became emblematic of New York punk, Ira remembers a diverse scene. The Dead Boys, Television, and The Talking Heads may not have sounded the same, but in economically-depressed 70s-era New York, they shared an attitude that \u201clife sucked, it\u2019s probably not going to get better, but so what.\u201d\n\nJim and Greg each choose a favorite track from the New York scene. Greg goes with the Talking Heads\u2019 \u201cDon\u2019t Worry About the Government\u201d from the band\u2019s self-titled debut. More than any other band, the Talking Heads epitomized New York punk\u2019s diversity. Their first gig may have been opening for the Ramones, but Greg contends the band\u2019s sound was more dance than punk. Still, Byrne\u2019s narrator in this song \u2013 a stressed, neurotic government bureaucrat \u2013 taps into the anxiety of the punk era. Jims goes with the ultimate American punk anthem, Richard Hell\u2019s \u201cBlank Generation.\u201d The story goes that U.K. punk impresario Malcolm McLaren saw Hell perform the song in the U.S., then returned home and advised The Sex Pistols to write something \u201cjust like it, but your own.\u201d\n\n3 Jim and Greg close out the show by reviewing the new, self-titled album from Brooklyn afrobeat band Antibalas. This is the fifth studio album from a group whose sound is largely the product of one man \u2013 Nigerian saxophone player and afrobeat inventor Fela Kuti. Kuti forged afrobeat from American jazz, African highlife, and tribal music, infusing the mix with potent political commentary. Antibalas are devotees of Fela, and recently played in and arranged the music for Fela! on Broadway. Jim\u2019s verdict: if you don\u2019t get an itch to start dancing listening to this music, you don\u2019t have a pulse. Antibalas aren\u2019t slaves to Fela\u2019s legacy. They too are political, but they\u2019re singing about modern day issues like the economy and immigration. Greg also observes that unlike the autocratic Fela, Antibalas is a democracy. There are some fine solos on this record, but what\u2019s really thrilling is how the band works together. Antibalas gets a double Buy It.","PullQuote":"","Recurringsegments":"","AlbumReviews":"Antibalas - Antibalas","FeaturedSongs":"Elvis Costello and The Attractions, \u201cRadio Radio,\u201d This Year\u2019s Model, Radar, 1978\nInsane Clown Posse, \u201cBoogie Woogie Wu,\u201d The Great Milenko, Hollywood\/Psychopathic, 1997\nThe Kingsmen, \u201cLouie,Louie,\u201d The Kingsmen in Person, Wand, 1963\nRamones, \u201cCretin Hop,\u201d Rocket to Russia, Sire, 1977\nThe Heartbreakers, \u201cBorn Too Loose,\u201d L.A.M.F., Track, 1977\nNew York Dolls, \u201cPersonality Crisis,\u201d New York Dolls, Mercury, 1973\nTelevision, \u201cProve It,\u201d Marquee Moon, Elektra, 1977\nRamones, \u201cSheena is a Punk Rocker,\u201d Rocket to Russia, Sire, 1977\nThe Dictators, \u201cTeengenerate,\u201d Go Girl Crazy!, Epic, 1975\nRamones, \u201cPinhead,\u201d Leave Home, Sire, 1977\nTelevision, \u201cFriction,\u201d Marquee Moon, Elektra, 1977\nTelevision, \u201cVenus de Milo\u201d Double Exposure, unofficial release, 1992\nTelevision, \u201cVenus,\u201d Marquee Moon, Elektra, 1977\nThe Heartbreakers, \u201cChinese Rocks,\u201d L.A.M.F., Track, 1977\nSuicide, \u201cGhost Rider,\u201d Suicide, Red Star, 1977\nThe Dead Boys, \u201cSonic Reducer,\u201d Young Loud and Snotty, Sire, 1977\nJames Chance, \u201cDish It Out,\u201d No New York, Antilles, 1978\nTelevision, \u201cMarquee Moon,\u201d Marquee Moon, Elektra, 1977\nTalking Heads, \u201cDon\u2019t Worry About the Government,\u201d Talking Heads: 77, Sire, 1977\nRichard Hell and The Voidoids, \u201cBlank Generation,\u201d Blank Generation, Sire, 1977\nRichard Hell and The Voidoids, \u201cDown at the Rock and Roll Club,\u201d Blank Generation, Sire, 1977\nAntibalas, \u201cThe Rat Catcher,\u201d Antibalas, Daptones, 2012\nAntibalas, \u201cDirty Money,\u201d Antiabalas, Daptones, 2012\nLukid, \u201cSnow Theme,\u201d Lonely at the Top, Werk Discs, 2012\nSuper Furry Animals, \u201cWherever I Lay My Phone (That\u2019s My Home),\u201d Guerilla, Creation, 1999\nWire, \u201cAmbitious,\u201d The Ideal Copy, Mute, 1987\nThe Wasps, \u201cCan\u2019t Wait Till 78,\u201d Live at the Vortex, NEMS, 1977\nSex Pistols, \u201c Problems,\u201d Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u2019s the Sex Pistols, Warner Bros., 1977\nThe Afghan Whigs, \u201cGentlemen,\u201d Gentlemen, Elektra, 1993\nWhy?, \u201cThe Vowels, Pt. 2,\u201d Alopecia, Anticon, 2008","Audio":"http:\/\/audio.soundopinions.org\/streams\/2012\/08\/so_20120817.m3u","MainImage":"http:\/\/www.soundopinions.org\/images\/2012\/1977_part2.jpg","FlickrPhotoSet":"","Videos":""}]
